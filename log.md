# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14th August Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn Ruby Fundamentals, completed a few ruby exercises!

**Thoughts:** Still weak on loops, arrays & hashes. The syntax is so different from what I've learned before in javascript/Java/PHP, think I need a lot more practise to get used to it.

### Day 2: 15th August Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class on loops, expressions, Classes etc. Completed Leetcode Ruby exercises, more to go

**Thoughts**: Better understanding on Ruby and it's application, down to the same period where you struggle & waste time on code to learn useful things through fixing mistakes and realising the right things to do. Kinda dry on the explaining parts and wish we could have more time to learn by doing & trying out even if it's IRB.. also wish I had more time to start coding projects already haha. I foresee myself useful a lot of Devdocs.io in the future :)

### Day 3: 16th August Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Leetcode exercises - YAY! Time to move on to Codewars :)

**Thoughts** Used a lot of code for Ruby exercises - code had a lot of extra checks, re-assignments & loops. Code was messy and unclear - note to self - always prepare pseudocode before starting to code. Read up more on Ruby and find out more on the classes & available functions/methods/classes that would help to save time/make things easier. Also, I wonder if my javascript will deprove after all these weeks of Ruby :/

### Day 4: 17th August Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Product Design process - from idea to product, and also the Software Development Life Cycle :) Tried Codewars!

**Thoughts** Was part of a startup before as a PM, being thrown into the process and learning about it is so different. I saw a lot of wireframes, drafts & plans of the project that dictated the product features, and also saw how the designer worked on these. Good to know
