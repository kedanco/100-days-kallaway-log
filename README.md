### Objectives of Round 3

1. To explore, build and create 3 variations of MERN Stack apps.

2. To create at least _5_ full-fledged, quality personal projects

3. To follow lesser guides and tutorials, and spend more time creating my own projects.

### Day 1: 24th February Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CS50

**Thoughts:** Finished lesson 6 of CS50, talking about Python. It was mostly focused on the syntax, but serves as a good introduction! Also tried a bit of Flask. Seeing Jinja inside Flask reminds me of Ruby on Rails.

### Day 2: 25th February Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CS50, Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Finished lesson 7 of CS50, covering Web Programming. Combining JS and python to create a web app with basic routes and validation serves as a easier,simpler version of a mern stack.

### Day 3: 26th February Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Added Danger animation into my Tetris! Not the nicest yet, still have things to improve on.

### Day 4: 27th February Wednesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Fixed the Danger and bonus animations! So happy to have these 2 animations working, finally feel the game being more interactive.

Added main menu and restart buttons to Pause Overlay but can't get it to work properly yet.

### Day 5: 28th February Thursday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CS50

**Thoughts:** Continued with Lesson 8 of CS50, covering SQL! Good refresher for the Poly days. Back then everything was varchar(255) but now I understand the different data types better.

### Day 6: 1st March Friday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished CS50!

**Thoughts:** The last video of CS50 wrapped up with a quick revision across the topics, and also important was the assurance about how:

- You're not supposed to understand and remember everything, no one is capable of that
- You'll find that the more you learn, the more you won't understand
- Basics and understanding of programming and computational thinking will be constantly helpful despite the language you go into

All in all, the course was very informative in the essential concepts a software engineer should have! Shall start on another CS resource after I'm done with my current projects!

### Day 7: 2nd March Saturday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Flappy Bird, BookTracker App

**Thoughts:** Followed CodingTeacher tutorial on FlappyBird and finally got this game up! Much things to add on, like a score and maybe add some challenges too? Though it seems kinda difficult to do.

Started on my personal BookTracker app. Kinda challenging to NOT look at any tutorial videos and try setting up a MERN Stack myself. Having multiple ways to structure your files has made me kinda confused, but I guess as I do more projects I'll start to understand when to use certain ways.

Learning Points:

- Not advisable to size/style canvas with CSS! Results in inaccurate sizes.

### Day 8: 3rd March Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Spent some time solving git errors. Reverted from a complicated design and just removed the restart and main menu buttons from pause.

### Missed A Day: 4th March Monday, 2019

### Day 9: 5th March Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Attempted to continue with dev bootcamp but still can't understand SVG and D3 section. Maybe I should pause this for awhile and try out FCC's curriculum on this.

### Day 10: 6th March Wednesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Completed the 2 remaining features in my Tetris project - displaying the next upcoming tetris block, and also updating and displaying user's high scores.

It's been a long time and I'm finally completing this game! Not everything is perfect but I'm proud of what I've done. The most important thing is I've come up with my own ideas, and implemented them myself, without following a tutorial.

That said, no major libraries and frameworks were used, and I wonder what kind of vanillajS project I'll work on next time.
