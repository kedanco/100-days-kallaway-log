### Day 1: 12th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course

**Thoughts:** Started back on my Round 2 by going through a Linux Udemy course. Even though i'm primarily using Linux for coding but there's so much idk about this OS, when it allows for so much possibilities in terms of configuration. Gonna be an interesting journey ;)

### Missed A Day : 14th September Friday, 2018

### Day 3: 15th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Personal Savings Calculator

**Thoughts:** Came up with a new layout for a company's site I'm helping out with, specifically just the savings calculator component. Working with previous CSS is hard especially when there's so many inline styles >< bad idea but I still went ahead and added some inside, because I'm unfamiliar w the CSS structure and didn't want to change anything. Managed to code out the layout I want, thank God for Inspector tools.

### Day 4: 16th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course, React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't take too much dry lecture on Linux in 1 day so I started on another React Node course to trigger my memories on whatever I've learned on React before. Also great to learn some Node. Wonder if I should do something more vanilla JS before learning about all these frameworks again.

### Day 5: 17th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Continued and learned more about setting up Express app, linked it to Heroku. Spent a shitload of time configuring and installing ohmyzsh and listening to explanation lectures, hope I'm reaching the code intensive part soon.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 6: 18th September Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course & Calculator

**Thoughts:** Set-up passportJS w google OAuth, Setup mongoose w mLab, refactored code and although there was little coding done, there was a lot of explanation throughout the videos and that at least made me understand the things we were doing.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 7: 19th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done w/ Authentication part of the course! Length explanations but good reminder of the 'proper' way to do things, what to take note of etc. Also worked on a existing wordpress site for a client - almost done!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 8: 20th September Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done with the Dev vs Prod section, learned a little more in detail about the 2 environments and how to prepare for them when committing a project somewhere, or dealing with API Keys and URI's. Started on React part of the course! After much time spent on the back-end set-up, it's finally time to start on the front-end!

### Missed A Day : 21st September Friday, 2018

### Day 9: 22nd September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Markdown and Commandline course

**Thoughts:** Realised that I didn't go through 2 of Wes Bos's courses touching on the basics of Markdown and Commandline. Managed to learn a bit more tips and tricks to make my workflow more efficient!

**Link to work:**

### Day 10: 23rd September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Started on the front-end part of the course, but when the videos began on explanations on reducers and how the whole React and Redux ecosystem works together, suddenly I'm confused again. Need to find a way to understand + remember the essence of it before moving on.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 11: 24th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Made quite a bit of progress today, but can't understand Redux fully. I think when I look at the code and trace where it goes systematically, I get a better understanding compared to listening to explanations. The best check is to be able to write the code from scratch yourself and understand what each code is for, but I'm not there yet!

### Missed A Day : 25th September Tuesday, 2018

### Day 12: 26th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CS50, React Node course

**Thoughts:** Started on CS50 lectures! Also completed the client side components and routing for the React Node application, gonna be touching on payments next.

### Day 13: 27th September Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

### Missed A Day : 28th September Friday, 2018

### Day 14: 29th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Completed billing part of application by setting up middleware, and ensuring that credit addition process works correctly. Very technical explanations but still wish there was a simplified version for me to understand what goes where.

**Link to work:**

### Day 15: 30th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Started documenting my freecodecamp learning points, and re-organised some of my notes. There's so much CSS stuff to take note that notes become really important, something to solidify my learning by writing down, and something to look back on.

**Link to work:**

### Day 16: 1st October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Codewars

**Thoughts:** Worked on some JS codewars today, other than doing basic FCC challenges, think codewars exercises is one of the best way to test your knowledge and understanding of the language. As usual, the one-liner answers after always put me to shock...

**Link to work:**

### Day 17: 2nd October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Completed the Accessibility section of FCC today, skipped the Flexbox and Grid areas and moved on to ES6! Gained a better understanding of the changes, makes me more confident to use it now.

**Link to work:**

### Day 18: 3rd October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Completed ES6 section of Freecodecamp! feels good to document the learning points down, something I can refer to someday. Spent majority of my other time wrapping up a Wordpress project for a client, glad to finally complete one!

**Link to work:**

### Day 19: 4th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Halfway through Regex portion of Freecodecamp! Loving this habit of taking notes.. Maybe coming up with my own cheatsheet one-day will help a lot as a summary too.

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 5th October Friday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 6th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 20: 7th October Sunday, 2018

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 21: 8th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 22: 9th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Added the Mailer class and configured it into the React Node application! With the diagrams and explanation, it was really easier to understand the steps. Gotta keep going.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 23: 10th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't solve the issue with mailing the survey into my email, all the code seems right but it just doesn't work. Probably some connectivity issue between client and server, not very productive day.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Missed A Day : 11th October Thursday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 12th October Friday, 2018

### Day 24: 13th October Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Vue JS Meetup

**Thoughts:** Went for a VueJS meetup today! Quite awesome to be learning it finally, definitely easier to start writing the first few lines of code compared to React. But, things get complicated when you start to add in the methods or start passing props around.

**Link to work:**

### Day 25: 14th October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial, Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Still couldn't solve the React Node connectivity issue. Did some freecodecamp, and moved on to the Tutorial on React's side. I figured if I felt messy with the current tutorial might as well do the default one.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 26: 15th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Completed another feature of the React page tutorial's tictactoe game. Played around with it and added my own restart button to display when the game is won. Understood it a bit better when I played around with it.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 27: 16th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Continued with TicTacToe Game! Implemented the Restart button on my own, and added the guided move history feature from the tutorial. Gonna continue to add more features into this game!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 28: 17th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Feelings accomplished today! Cleared 4 more features off my React TicTacToe Game :)

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 29: 18th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Added confetti and victory fanfare music to the app! Started with improving the aesthetics.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 30: 19th October Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Solved an issue with the confetti when restarting the game. Took very long with this bug, and finally learned how ComponentDidUpdate works. Still kinda blur about how diff functions get re-arranged around but it's better now. Another unsolved bug with the 'Next Player' status display, have a feeling it's also got to do with setState callbacks.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 20th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 31: 21st October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Solved the previous bug. Could have binded diff functions to `this` but just shifted the setState code into React's lifecycle methods for it to make more sense. Also done with the aesthetics improvement!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 22nd October Monday, 2018

### Day 32: 23rd October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Able to Setup a form for switching around the Player icons! Though it works, the player can change the Letter/Icon at any point throughout the game and that inserts a 3rd letter into the board. Need to work on restricting that change to before the game starts.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 33: 24th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Continued with Data structures portion of Freecodecamp! Went through objects and arrays syntax and methods, good revision.

**Link to work:**

### Day 34: 25th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Started on Object-Oriented Programming part of Freecodecamp :) Halfway through, but glad that it touched on `prototype` as I have always wondered why it always appears when dealing with objects.

**Link to work:**

### Day 35: 26th October Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Manage to complete check off 4 items off my feature list! Really motivated to push through and finish this soon. This constant practise has been great building up a momentum to stay familiar with the code and continue improving the app!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 27th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 36: 28th October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp, TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Done with OOP section of Freecodecamp! Some old stuff, some new stuff, but always something that amazed me with JS. Only left with the Functional Programming section and I'm done with this certificate! Also took time to finish the CSS Grid section since I'm using it for the TicTacToe Game. For the game, I managed to display the ranking board, and fix a bug where status won't reset properly after Player2 wins. Also revised the requirements for the app. Gonna use localStorage to store the ranks, and also plan to refactor my code to be more React-like. Haven't been making use of Components to separate the code and now everything is just one big chunk inside index.js

### Day 37: 29th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day rushing my Wordpress wireframes, but managed to squeeze in time to complete of the Responsive web projects : A Survey form! Had some trouble aligning radio buttons/checkboxes with their labels, but all's good with some help from `<li>`. It's been sometime since I just worked on HTML and CSS, so simple but great refresher.

**Link to work:**

### Day 38: 30th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp, TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Wanted to continue with the next FCC project, a landing page, but it required flexbox, so I'm gonna learn that and do the project together another time. Done setting up ranking board for TicTacToe, Allowed player to edit their name (so that they can save their score under their name), and added a button to reset the rankings.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 39: 31st October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Continued with Freecodecamp, completed the Flexbox section and worked on the landing page.

### Missed A Day : 1st November Thursday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 2nd November Friday, 2018

### Day 40: 3rd November Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Added the last feature into the game, which is a button to reset the icons to default. Pretty simple since I've gotten used to using componentDidUpdate to change state and re-render changes.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 41: 4th November Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Cudy Platform

**Thoughts:** After shifting a lot of code around, finally managed to solve the responsiveness issue. Settling CSS took longer than figuring out the logic error. This is what happens when there is no proper structure in place when adding CSS. Flexbox exists but not utilised, inline-styling all over and different conventions and naming patterns floating around.

**Link to work:**

### Day 42: 5th November Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Completed my TicTacToe game!!! Refactoring the render functions into Components wasn't that difficult once I understood how state and props worked. Finally felt like I have gained a good level of understanding of how React works so far. Think there's still a number of things that I need to learn but this was a good milestone. Took a lot of hours and days to really work on this consistently.

**Link to work:**

### Day 43: 6th November Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Took some time to do up my Landing Page properly! Learned another way to use an image for a section's background, learned that I'm more used to CSS Grid than Flexbox (don't like how it works), and that HTML and CSS skills really need consistent sharpening no matter how good we get with other languages.
Almost to 50days!!

**Thoughts:** Halfway through functional programming section of FCC. Being absent for a week after finishing my TicTacToe project wasn't a very good move. Very tempted to start on another project but think I should finish up these front 2 sections of FCC first!
