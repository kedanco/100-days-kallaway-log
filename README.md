# 100 Days Of Code (Round 1) - Log

### Day 1: 3rd January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started on Backend Portal project, Rails Revision

**Thoughts:** Needed to revise on Ruby and Rails, after such a long time of spending my time doing other things, whatever I learned about Ruby and Rails seemed to have become pretty rusty...Thank gooodness we had our old projects for reference!

Spent some time planning and organising migration files, this process required me to revisit the project structure and plan out the models/fields needed before I even started migratin anything (reduce 'change' migration actions).

Slowly but surely, I'm gonna get my skills back.

### Day 2: 4th January Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Backend Portal project

**Thoughts:** Preparing the essentials: homepage, flashes, setting up folders and files.

### Day 3: 5th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Backend Portal Project

**Thoughts:** Did up the main few pages, spent some time getting pissed over CSS (Arranging and aligning icons and text in DIVs, in the end a simple Table did the job pretty easily.) Filled up some content for the individual pages (contact, home etc.) Still got much to do for back-end!

### Day 4: 6th January Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued Backend Portal Project, Javascript30 Day 1

**Thoughts:** Today I started on the Javascript 30 challenge! I realised that since i'm stuck with the intermediate algorithms challenges on FCC, maybe I can strengthen my basics by starting on this before heading back. The difficulty of the challenges is really a notch higher than the previous ones...

The first project is a Drumkit - Having different buttons play different drum sounds whenever the user presses the respective keys! Got it done in an hour or two but spent some time trying to add in mouseclicks (not that simple since there's multiple elements), maybe next time!

Also touched up my portfolio site - it's so time-consuming writing the content from scratch and manually writing CSS for each element... Well it's all in the name of practise! Hopefully next time I will have a set of CSS shortcut snippets at my disposal :)

### Day 5: 7th January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 2, Portfolio Site,

**Thoughts:** 2nd day of Javascript 30!
Using CSS variables to edit image properties and values, also learned the difference between nth-child and nth-of-type (Important!)

Gonna add the 'gallery with filter' feature to my projects - not sure how I'm gonna nest everything under Javascript30 but well, gonna make my site nice!

### Day 6: 8th January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 3

**Thoughts:** Apparently I missed a project - CSS Variables was the 3rd video. But anyways, completed the 2nd project today - a CSS + JS Clock! It was kinda difficult to get the 'center' correct and align the 'hands' of the clock correctly, but everything was rather smooth and easy to understand.

With simple if statements, I even managed to fix a glitchy transition whenever the clock reset to 0 seconds. yay!

### Day 7: 9th January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 4

**Thoughts:** Managed to squeeze in time to complete my JS30 before another dance class - handling arrays today! Had a great time trying out and following the video, and editing my answers to the ES6 syntax.

Since everything's console-log based in this lesson, I don't think I'll put it up unless I have a very great idea how to display these.. haha!

### Day 8: 10th January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 5

**Thoughts:** Flex panels was fun. Always wanted to do something like this! Shall dedicate some time to learning flex after I'm familiar with Grid.

Maybe for my dance site, I should add this in as one of the contents on the site.

### Day 9: 11th January Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 6

**Thoughts:** Spare time's getting shorter everyday, Now i can barely manage to complete an hour of coding.

Started my coding quite late, and was quite sleepy by the time I was done with my Javascript project. Gotta prioritise this more the next time!

**Link to work:** kedanco.com/projects

### Day 10: 12th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 7

**Thoughts:** Revised Day 6's work and got Day 7 done pretty quickly - Simpler array exercises compared to the first one.

**Link to work:** kedanco.com/projects

### Day 11: 13th January Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 8, Project page

**Thoughts:** Today's project was on HTML Canvas, and it was fun! Well, this tutorial is pretty much the tip of the iceberg, and I'm sure there's so much more available things to play with. Heck, there's even 3D Canvas that can animate and rotate stuff around!

Also did up a proper image grid for my portfolio site's project page! Almost wanted to give up making a text label appear over when hovering on top of the image, but managed to make it work. Gonna add image transition and also prepare the images for my projects! Excited to finish it!

### Day 12: 14th January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 9 & 10

**Thoughts:** Today, I found out that creating a range of numbers in Javascript, from X to Y, was highly inconvenient. I miss the awesome (1..4) notation in Ruby where it was so convenient, and we could directly do a loop after that.

After some researching, I found that a normal for loop would be the best way. Well, I spent a little more time but I managed to do project 10 by myself! :D

Project 9 was a very simple lesson on multiple console. commands, so I decided to just move on to 10.

### Day 13: 15th January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 11

**Thoughts:** Playing around with HTML5 Video controls was pretty fun! Nothing wildly interesting, or mathematically challenging for this project but at least we covered an important part of this form of media - videos!

Was stuck on the fullscreen button for a little while but managed to accomplish it. Yay!

**Link to work:** kedanco.com/projects

### Day 14: 16th January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 12 & 13

**Thoughts:** Today's projects on Key Sequence Detection & Slide on Scroll was pretty simple.

For the Key sequence, it was a simple 5-min video on event-listening to user's keyboard inputs and checking them against an array.

Sliding images in on scroll was more interesting, I've seen countless websites, especially landing pages, utilize this to make the website more interactive, and I've always wondered how to make it happen, even reverse it.

Thanks to the previous CSS Clock project that covered transforming and translating X and Y values, this project was easier to understand. Gonna implement it soon!

Also uploaded my first few JS30 projects to my portfolio site! Gonna find time to add everything in soon :D

**Link to work:** kedanco.com/projects

### Day 15: 17th January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 14

**Thoughts:** Barely enough time for coding today! Covered a familiar topic - data types that pass by value or reference. An important concept that solved the simplest but most head-scratching of problems, and something that I read about again in YDKJS

Squeezed out time for the video, understoof and best takeaway were the multiple methods that allow for copying by value from arrays! Dealing with objects still seem pretty limited.

Also, prepared the rest of my screenshots today. Gonna be filling up my js30 image grid!

### Missed A Day : 18th January Thursday, 2018

### Day 16: 19th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 15 & 16

**Thoughts:** Caught up with my JS30 progress! Learned about the localStorage object on browsers, Event Delegation (using different eventlistener for different things) and CSS Text Shadow effct!

Quite fun to play around though I think recently I've been 'following' the videos a tad too strictly and haven't been playing around much. Now that I'm past the halfway mark, I'm gonna do a revision either tmr or Sunday before proceeding on with the remaining projects :)

Also, Spent some time understanding and editing the navbar of my portfolio site - learned about the HTML version of css media query!

using window.matchMedia, (and a eventlistener if you wish to check for media with change after browser load), I tried inserting/removing HTML elements. I had to deal with nodelists (the list of items that the DOM returns) and the childNodes function, which didn't work out so well. I also tried adding .pull-right class to the buttons for a different alignment.

I ended up doing a simple replacing the innerHTML with a new string of html code.

Done.

I'm sure there's a shorter way to do this, but this feels smart at the moment. Great learning today :)

### Missed A Day : 20th January Saturday, 2018

### Day 17 : 21st January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 17 & 18, Backend Portal

**Thoughts:** Project on Sorting names (dealing with strings), and also using .map and .reduce to add a list of time together.

Spent a chunk of time extending the sorting one into multiple functions and also making a button that could switch to choose to sort with or without articles!

Code was (obviously) longer than the simple version in the video but I learned quite a lot doing my own things :)
Also it's been some time since I made an effort to do that!

Project 18 was pretty simple & straightforward, but I'm amazed by how concise code can be using map and reduce. It's like back to dealing with Ruby code.

Back to working on the Backend Portal project today. Spent a shit load of time figuring out flex for the navbar.

Also discovered css :not() rule! So useful for exceptions :)
You can actually chain it together like li:hover:not(.class)

Did quite a bit of work (though, really really slow) for the e-commerce homepage. Feels assuring knowing that I configured it to be responsive as I was putting in the skeleton so that it won't come back to haunt me next time :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 18 : 22nd January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 19, Backend Portal

**Thoughts:** Today I realise the more time I have, and the more I am willing to dedicate to doing projects & trying out new stuff, the more time I spend debugging with Chrome Devtools and the more I understand about how to go about solving problems and improving my css layouts.

For my e-commerce project, I'm done with Footer, improved the navbar, sorted out container heights and edited the spacing here and there. gonna move on to the back-end which would require more rails :)

Faced an annoying https issue with day 19's project. It's like solving codepen with fcc projects again. Stuff like this sometimes reduce my faith in technology :rollseye:

**Link to work:** 

### Day 19 : 23rd January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Udemy Node Course

**Thoughts:** Went back to Udemy's Node course and started from the bottom again! Preparation for the Alpha Camp meet-up tmr on the MEAN Stack - after much tutorial-following, reading and endless MongoDB troubleshooting, finally managed to get my first MEAN stack app working!

Injected some basic data into mongo, ran the app with node, and connected these 2 through express.

Not exploring Angular for the front-end yet, maybe that'll come later. Gotta rush to get this app working before tmr :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 20 : 24th January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Url Shortener App, Alpha Camp Meetup

**Thoughts:** Today was an amazing day, every little time that I squeezed out in between my dance classes to rush this Url Shortener app turned out to be extremely productive : I managed to solve error after error, and recognize my little steps of progress here and there throughout the day. Even though I was sleepy sometimes (mostly on the train), I managed to get the app working at the end of the day!

It's 10.37pm here at Alpha Camp, and it feels good to be back. The meetup was awesome, with people contributing different things that they learned. I found that spending time to explore, research and tweak stuff here and there leads you to question & find out how, and why the code works (or does not work)

I feel pretty satisfied with my progress (the patience and effort... is worth it), and I can't imagine joining a Hackathon one day to squeeze out a product in an environment of higher intensity.

Comparing to Rails, I don't think I'm going to start exploring another MEAN app anytime now, as I've still got stuff I need to do, but I'm gonna definitely beautify this app and host it somewhere (without the entire bloated node_modules folder, probably?)

Alright, back to JS30 and Rails tmr. :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 21 : 25th January Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 19,20

**Thoughts:** Solved the previous issue by just starting my project up with a proper localhost server (npm start) instead of local file, and the commands worked.

Went through the video again, and continued on to day20's speech recognition project.

I still think it's pretty amazing how some stuff are built into browsers that most sites dont totally utilize. Should build a few projects revolving around these for fun :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 22 : 26th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 21, Backend Portal 

**Thoughts:** Today's js30 project was about geolocating speed and compass! Unfortunately, this required a phone simulation to carry out, and I haven't got around to doing it.. the code was pretty short and simple to understand though!

Continued to do my Rails project, and I spent a good time solving basic routing errors (sounds like first few weeks of bootcamp), but just some reading up got me to understand what I missed out in my project. Sometimes the things I miss out are things that were handled by other group members in previous projects.

I took quite a long time to style the forms, but at least most of the CSS were re-applicable. I haven't even touched all the back-end stuff yet, damn!

**Link to work:** 

### Missed A Day : 27th January Saturday, 2018

### Day 23 : 28th January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 22, Backend Portal 

**Thoughts:** Spent a big chunk of my time today on reading up and my Backend Portal Rails project. Went through the different Slack channels for 100DaysOfCode and realise I should ask for collaboration projects next time over there haha!

Today's JS30 was on creating a smooth pill-like background that appears whenever you mouseover a link, across the page! Pretty short and straight-forward, I wonder why I haven't thought of doing it myself.

It felt great to be progressing on my rails project, finally I can feel the skills returning to me! Doing things that were previously done is easy, I think the challenge will come when I need to create the tags, filters and product variations properly. (I only did a hack-ish filter last time around).

**Link to work:** 

### Day 24 : 29th January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 23, YDKJS, Backend Portal 

**Thoughts:** Managed to get the Cart working! Glad that I did up my old code properly, if not I would be having more problems right now :laughs: Inevitably, I faced some bugs, but progress was good considering the time I had today.

JS30 Day23's project was about a Speech Synthesizer that could read out text on the page with an adjustable speed and pitch. pretty interesting, and immediately I went on to google if anyone did a Rap version. It actually exists, though outdated and not exactly working properly.

Glad that I'm back to reading up on YDKJS. A chapter a day shouldn't be too difficult :) Motivation for this is actually the CS + WD Trello board, which I aim to complete by early 2019.. 1 year to go, should be possible right :) let's push!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 25 : 30th January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 24, Backend Portal 

**Thoughts:** Today was a 'I hate jQuery!!' kinda day. Spent a big chunk of my time debugging stupid errors when Vanilla JS could've done the job easily.

But, at least I (kinda) did up my first proper dropdown menu (with a very nice pointy triangle at the top). I'll soon be done with the User side of the project, minus the complicated order & paying processes!

Today's JS30 was on making a sticky nav. I had already learned how to copy and style one, but having a stylish animation for another tab appearing was awesome.

TIL:
- The triangle is made from a box, with only 1 side of visible border
- jQuery is not as helpful as it is supposed to be
- fixed elements do not take up space in the browser, they float above other elements

**Link to work:** 

### Day 26 : 31st January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Backend Portal

**Thoughts:** Squeezed in an hour or two in between my classes today. Encountered bugs that I didn't know how to solve, but moved on to continue the backend Rails site. Time to stackoverflow that problem!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 27 : 1st Feb Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Backend Portal

**Thoughts:** Trying to finish this portal as fast as possible, so haven't been continuing with JS30. Definitely have time for that tmr though, maybe I'll aim to complete 2-3 projects to catch-up.

Almost done with the user account side of the portal, It's the CSS that's slowing me down right now :(.

Found out that CS50 has other lectures available and not just normal programming fundamentals. Definitely will check them out after I'm done with this!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 28 : 2nd Feb Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Backend Portal, JS30 Day 25,26

**Thoughts:** Back to JS30! Project on creating appearing submenu's (following the previous project on mouseover - white bg) and also on how event captures work.

There's always new stuff to learn through these projects but I realise I haven't been applying it to my current Rails backend portal where I do have a sub-menu.

Time to change up the code for better flexibility!

Also, decent progress on the Rails project, did up some layouts (no big issue today) but I can foresee the hassle as I'm gonna do up a whole edit form for the user's details..

**Link to work:** 

### Day 29 : 3rd Feb Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Backend Portal, JS30 Day 27, FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Today's work on the portal was confusing as hell. Realised I had the address attributes under User, but User could have more than 1 set of address - there was no place to store the extra values. Created an Address model and tried to reorganise the forms. Now having the forms in between user, devise and address routes this shit is gonna get confusing.

Today's JS30 project was cool, learned how to get page/mouse X values to drag a slider with mouseclick (normally able with shift-scroll)

Gotta finish the User side functionalities soon.

Anyway, managed to squeeze in time (and patience) to solve 4 of the Intermediate Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp! Finally back here after so long, and it was because I was so stuck on the Roman Numerals problem.
Sometimes, it's perfectly fine to ask for a little help :)

Was supposed to finish my front-end cert tomorrow, but I guess it'll need to be postponed.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 30 : 4th Feb Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JS30 Day 28, FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** FreeCodeCamp progress today was awesome. Solved 6 challenges (2 more than yesterday!) and did a lot of javascript reading along the way - operators I didn't know existed, details and differences between some of them, potential pitfalls to take note of.

Even though I still need to refer for basic tasks dealing with strings and the like, at least everything feels easier and smoother now as I'm coding through the challenges. That is, until I encountered a challenge that needed regex - Regular Expressions

Regex is F-ed up. It's magic when it works, but it's confusing as hell and difficult to pick up... need a lot of patience for this one.

JS30 today on a Video Speed Controller UI, pretty straightforward but I'm still amazed how the video is actually below 10 mins.
Wonder when will I be able to be as savvy as this :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 31 : 5th Feb Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JS30 Day 29, FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Continued with 2 FCC Exercises! Today's JS30 project on Countdown Clock was quite different, dealing with integer to time values, converting them and displaying.

Encountered a Lowest Common Multiple Range challenge on FCC and totally didn't understand what's going on. These mathematical stuff still feels difficult to understand. Need more practise..

**Link to work:** 

### Day 32 : 6th Feb Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** !!JS30 Day 30!!

**Thoughts:** I'm finally done with Wes Bos's #Javascript30 challenge! Finally I can spend time finishing other things on FCC and doing the new grid/flexbox course :D

Today's project on the Whack-A-Mole game was extremely fun! I've always wanted to challenge my skills with game/product/website creation and not with boring exercises... haha! But well, we need to do those to test ourselves and learn right. I guess maybe I could push myself to learn more by creating stuff rather than practising with exercises.

Added my own difficulty and timelimit input to the game.
Also added a wooden mallet as a custom cursor, and to rotate (hammer) when clicked)
It's been sometime since I added extra features to JS30 projects :)
I think I'll find the time to add in LocalStorage, A ranking board and (maybe) the option to change cursor images!


**Link to work:** 

### Day 33 : 7th Feb Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Update portfolio site, FCC Challenges

**Thoughts:** FCC was straightforward for the next 2. The challenge passed in 2 arguments, 1 was an array and 2nd was a function with a condition.

The 2 challenges were to return the result, and drop elements if the condition were true.
I learned that return true; is used to break out of array.some :)

**Link to work:** 

### Day 34 : 8th Feb Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Work on Whack A Mole Game

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time these few days. Worked on the Whack A Mole game, improved the CSS. haven't got to work on the leaderboard yet.

**Link to work:** 

### Day 35 : 9th Feb Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Rails backend

**Thoughts:** Productive time on the Rails Portal, coded on the train and in between classes. Just a bit more before I’m done with the whole Users Module and can move on to Admin!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 36 : 10th Feb Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Rails backend

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time today solving silly mistakes, and falling asleep but I got most of the addresses part done. Now left with editing addresses, and changing passwords!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 37 : 11th Feb Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Google Apps Script, FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Read up on lines and lines of code but I don't completely understand what's going on... But managed to follow a tutorial and build the following:
1st Project - Using event data from an excel sheet, build a Google Form that gets user's RSVP for the different events. Thereafter, send a google calendar invite to the user, and provide them with a google doc containing instructions :)

2nd Project - Publish a webpage with Google Script, and retrieve JSON from an API and display it.

Google Script actually has loads of potential to make using Google Tools easier!

Also, managed to finish the last Intermediate Algorithm challenge on FCC! It was kinda challenging as it dealt with returning a function, and then calling it as a IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). Shall aim to finish the Advanced Algo's by this week!

**Link to work:** 

### Day 38 : 12th Feb Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Google Apps Script

**Thoughts:** Managed to get the HTML and CSS working with Google Script! But the JS really works in a funny way... guess GS is a good tool to deal with the other Google Products but not really nice when just working with the default HTML webpage structure :/

After the meetup today, I realised that everything actually works fine if you lump it in as 1 html file, it just becomes a hassle if you wish to include scripts or styles in separate files from the editor itself. Any files to be included normally works as per normal.

A few of the use cases we discussed today:
Using Spreadsheet to create form > add events to Calendar
Using Spreadsheet to return data from a Telegram Bot
Populating a Spreadsheet with data from a webpage form
Bulk marking emails as 'read'
Running a Google Script Cron Job to check online status of Heroku site
From Spreadsheet, send SMS to list of users

So much to learn, my code was barely innovative/impressive. It's not a competition, but I shall try harder next time :)
