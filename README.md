# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14th August Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn Ruby Fundamentals, completed a few ruby exercises!

**Thoughts:** Still weak on loops, arrays & hashes. The syntax is so different from what I've learned before in javascript/Java/PHP, think I need a lot more practise to get used to it.

### Day 2: 15th August Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class on loops, expressions, Classes etc. Completed Leetcode Ruby exercises, more to go

**Thoughts**: Better understanding on Ruby and it's application, down to the same period where you struggle & waste time on code to learn useful things through fixing mistakes and realising the right things to do. Kinda dry on the explaining parts and wish we could have more time to learn by doing & trying out even if it's IRB.. also wish I had more time to start coding projects already haha. I foresee myself useful a lot of Devdocs.io in the future :)

### Day 3: 16th August Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Leetcode exercises - YAY! Time to move on to Codewars :)

**Thoughts**: Used a lot of code for Ruby exercises - code had a lot of extra checks, re-assignments & loops. Code was messy and unclear - note to self - always prepare pseudocode before starting to code. Read up more on Ruby and find out more on the classes & available functions/methods/classes that would help to save time/make things easier. Also, I wonder if my javascript will deprove after all these weeks of Ruby :/

### Day 4: 17th August Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Product Design process - from idea to product, and also the Software Development Life Cycle :) Tried Codewars!

**Thoughts**: Was part of a startup before as a PM, being thrown into the process and learning about it is so different. I saw a lot of wireframes, drafts & plans of the project that dictated the product features, and also saw how the designer worked on these. Good to learn and go through the process properly :) The brainstorming exercise as also useful to teach us how to identify & prioritise the features - and then putting it up visually so we have a better image of it.

### Day 5: 18th August Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned & used git/Github! Started on TicTacToe exercise w/ Regent

**Thoughts** I tried to use Git/Github before and didn't understand how it worked. Today's exercise was really useful, because we practised until we learned how to resolve conflicts when editing the same file with another person! Also, I now understand how to properly fork repositories and upload your commits to github. This makes any dev work so much more convenient if there's any work I wish to post up :) Maybe it's time to really beautify my Github Page and do something with it!

### Day 6: 19th August Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practised Codewars

**Thoughts** Struggled with some of the exercises... one involving encoding duplicate strings, and one that needs to return the first non repeating letter. Realised that even though my code was able to resolve most, some special test cases came up and I needed to revise my strategy :/ a lot of time wasted but I think i'm getting used to a lot of the useful Ruby Magic Methods haha.

### Day 7: 20th August Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some reading on dojo materials, Wrote a basic Kopi<>English translation app!

**Thoughts** So I cleared some of the homework videos we had on computational thinking, and also one link on advanced html/css. Think that's something I have to remind myself as I continue to learn. Then, managed to finish most of a basic app that translates between our singaporean 'kopi' ordering slangs to english! Had this conversation with some of them at lunch that some of us weren't sure what the slangs meant and we'll need to google to know it... Maybe this app can make life more convenient (there's already existing ones on android but I just felt like trying). You're welcome to download it, run it and see how it works :D
P.s. Used instance variables for the hashes involved but not sure if it's the right thing to do? If not, how do you access variables in another methods?

### Day 8: 21st August Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Alphacamp) Gone through Leetcode exercises, continued with TicTacToe exercise

**Thoughts**: Managed to learn and review a lot today, I think it's great that Alpha Camp has time for the class to go through the code we did and learn from it together. We get to see different approaches and also understand how to make the code better in many ways - be it for readability, efficiency or just making things easier for ourselves.

Almost done with the TicTacToe exercise! Great to see something coming together just from the first 2 weeks here - and especially because it's a new language that I haven't done before :) Really excited to commit more time to complete some mini-projects I have thought of! On a side note, can't wait to finally have the skills to develop my own site.

Haven't been on FreeCodeCamp for awhile now. Wonder if I will have the time to continue and finish it within this course :/?

### Day 9: 22nd August Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back to basics with HTML & CSS, learned Flexbox

**Thoughts**: I've always had this sense of doubt whenever I read complicated CSS or JS files - sometimes I feel I will never understand how the whole thing works. I guess it's finally time to get my HTML/CSS skills up. My JS skills will probably need some revising too...so much to do! Feels like I'm juggling multiple languages at once @.@

**Link(s) to work**: http://flexboxfroggy.com/

### Day 10: 23rd August Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with HTML & CSS basics, tried creating a basic website!

**Thoughts**: Wow, totally forgot to update this log...Tired from the night before - stayed up late working on a 'page' for my domain. Finally got my own 'brand' domain name, set-up the hosting and got a 'Work in Progress' screen up! I've done previous websites before, but they were all local and I always wondered how much It'll take to setup your own site. It wasn't totally straightforward but it's cool that I finally did it! Also, finally had a proper explanation on the HTML CSS Box Model :)

### Day 11: 24th August Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Bootstrap lesson! Attempted TicTacToe AI but failed :(

**Thoughts**: After some hints from friends and a general online search, I found out that TicTacToe algorithm can actually be done using this Minimax Algorithm. Though, the process requires recursion and somehow my recursions don't get done correctly. If this was run in an IDE maybe it could be easier with the step-in debugging method (Like how Chrome Debugging can be used for javascript, go try it) but well, It'll take some time too. Can't fully understand the recursion process and how things went wrong but, oh well.

### Day 12: 25th August Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Github Pages - used it to organise previous projects

**Thoughts**: Always thought Github pages was only for a website page - then I realise Github allows each repo to have it's own page - thereby you're able to put each repo/project up on a website! 

**Link(s) to work**: http://github.com/kedanco

### Day 13: 26th August Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codewars exercise!

**Thoughts**: Didn't have as much time these past few days - got busy preparing for Night Festival performances :/ Still glad I did some Ruby today - As always the 'model' answers part really amazes me. So much more to work on - but there's also the portfolio page. Crunch time!

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 14: 27th August Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Portfolio Site!

**Thoughts**: Wasted some time configuring the domain & email for my site... I need to stop getting distracted and focus on getting the content up first! Such a bad habit. Anyway, there's stuff that still required time to do, and there's open space on the website that I'm unsure what to fill up with... dance stuff? more info? Maybe I should look at some freelance portfolio sites for reference.

**Link(s) to work**: http://kedanco.github.io/

### Day 15: 28th August Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review portfolio page, Ruby on Rails Webpage

**Thoughts**: Today I saw how different teammates did up their portfolio - some were having different struggles, some similar to mine, some had really impressive pages. Reflecting on my progress so far, I really need to put more time & effort into it to push myself - I know how much higher I can achieve if I had the time.

Ruby on Rails was so different - and difficult to catch-up. I was really lagging behind and didn't understand much of the lesson until I managed to get my Ubuntu system sorted out. Lesson learned: always be prepared with your resources and not wait until the last minute to rush.

I think it's time to set goals for myself through the weeks - what do I wish to achieve in the various things I'm working on throughout the weeks?

### Day 16: 29th August Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: TicTacToe Assignment Walkthrough, added bootstrap & Sass to Rails

**Thoughts**: Watching the process of our instructor explaining & building the TicTacToe systematically was amazing. when you plan out your structure & functions nicely, everything seems to work out fine & become very convenient (code-wise)
We also learned how to edit our layout 'templates' in Rails - which can be very convenient when we're building multiple pages!
Once again, experienced some error in my Ruby/RVM but managed to solve it & catch-up. Hope thats the last of it!

Looking forward to more :)

### Day 17: 30th August Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added css animation to portfolio page, added viewcounter on RoR webpage!

**Thoughts**: When we had the assignment to add a viewcounter into our webpage, we genuinely didn't know where to start. It was fiddling around and trying out different things (I ended up creating methods inside the Viewcounter class). After one of us got it, I finally managed to complete it with some referencing & asking questions.

This is probably why the Rails MVC diagram is so important - it allows us to understand where to put our code :)
It genuinely felt good when I start to understand what I'm doing & the code works. Here's to more epiphany on this journey!

### Day 18: 31st August Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created blog application with RoR - CRUD without Destroy!

**Thoughts**: Ok, so finally reading all about CRUD functions in my previous job, and about how a blog application is normally the first project for RoR practise, I finally realise how it all falls in place together. Honestly, without the instructor explaining so systematically and even prompting us to find/think of the answer ourselves, I don't think we could've figured out the way to do it. MVC model is so important, I feel like I have to spend some extra time to understand it further. Can't wait to start building Rails applications of my own :D

### Day 19: 1st September Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Random Quote Machine, Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Finally back to FCC! Felt like challenging myself today, so I went ahead and started the Random Quote Machine project. I remember clearing all the previous code tutorials and then stopping for a few weeks when I saw these projects; they were not guided and it became significantly harder than completing a tutorial - you would need to create a working project.

That said, after countless tries of CSS adjustments, HTML and javascript google searches, the program finally works! Just had a little bit of HSTS issue with Codepen, but everything ended on time for dinner. I was in Starbucks from around 12.45pm, added some responsiveness to my portfolio page and started with this shortly after. I would say it was a really productive 5-6 hours :)

What made progress quick was that I constantly tried to improve the CSS, completing the tasks part by part, and then trying to find the best reference/help to whatever problem I was facing. There's just no stopping the satisfaction.

I wonder if I can finish the next project within 6 hours as well?

### Day 20: 2nd September Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rails CRUD Destroy

**Thoughts**: Wasted so much time on the CRUD Destroy function. Can't seem to understand how figuring out a button can take 2 hours but, oh well. Rails is starting to get on my nerves - I'd have to figure out which file to write in, even if I'm gonna write some simple code. Sometimes solutions don't help either - not solving your problen. And somehow, Rails is supposed to be easy to understand. How about no.

### Missed A Day : 3rd September Sunday 2017 ###

### Day 21: 4th September Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review of CRUD Destroy process homework, Codewars & User Stories

**Thoughts**: Lesson went through the process of creating a To-Do App, and we had to come up w/ user stories. Also cleaned up some rust on Ruby by working on Codewars, felt good to be able to finish the exercises fast! If only RoR was as straightforward as Ruby.. haha. Anyway, had some doubts cleared regarding the delete button we were working on.

Lesson pace feels ok so far, just wish I had time for FCC and my portfolio site... I think I'll only have lesser time from now on for all these stuff.

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 22: 5th September Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated Rails blog app w CRUD - Destroy, and added basic CSS.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have time to write this entire week - so here's some late updating. So far, able to imagine how useful rails can be, but I don't know what I can use if I were to build a few-paged website. Pretty no point right, to be going through the Rails hassle, I mean, I'm still pretty used to creating with HTML & CSS. And to do Rails, I would have to switch over to Ubuntu so.. :/

### Day 23: 6th September Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review of Rails CRUD homework, Codewars Code Kata

**Thoughts**: It's been more than a week since I last updated my own portfolio page, and a potential 'Landing Page' gig has got to require some previous work done...the existing To-Do App doesn't seem entirely easy also, I wonder if I'll be able to make substantial progress this weekend :/ But, so far lessons have been very well-paced with us able to catch and understand what the instructor's saying. I guess you could say we're progressing well? haha. Let's see how we fare with the To-Do App!

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 24: 7th September Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practise on Rails redirect, render, adding fonts & images! Codewars kata

**Thoughts**: This week flew by so fast. Everyday we're doing something different in Rails. It feels good to be learning consistently, but as the same time with dance practises resuming it feels kinda shitty to not have the time to do what I need to : building other projects and working on my portfolio page. Kinda feels like I'm stuck whenever I commit to learning something. Well, it's effort but like everyone else, I just wish I had more time everyday. Guess it's really time to sleep a wee bit lesser and spend more time on my laptop haha!

### Day 25: 8th September Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved UI on To-Do App

**Thoughts**: yay I'm a quarter there! But, today was a distracting day - should have just studied in NP with proper wifi and plug. Didn't manage to do much - instead I spent time figuring out how to install Psiphon on Linux, or reading up if Loading Ubuntu in VMWare was a better idea.

**Today's Progress**: Improved UI on To-Do App

### Day 27: 10th September Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with Tasklist functionality, read up on PWA

**Thoughts**: Today was quite productive, minus all the errors that I've been facing! Finally focused and got something done. Also, found out about Progressive Web Applications and it seems magical. I wonder if PWAs are gonna slowly take over mobile apps. Still, you can't deny there's some benefits about making native apps.

No time to write my blog post at all - I'll have to do it another time.

### Day 28: 11th September Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: ToDoApp Review, Photo App Basics

**Thoughts**: Today we reviewed our Todo App, and also got started on a new Photo album application! (Think Instagram)

I felt my Todo App was pretty bad. Incomplete functions, Incomplete UI...But I managed to solve an error towards the end of the class that greatly helped my progress. I finally finished all CRUD functions for Tasks and Tasklists! Yay! The review allowed me to witness what amazing things my friends had done - I had clearly not put in enough effort into this assignment. Time to work harder!

We did up improved use cases for the Photo App and drew out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) - which shows how different Models are supposed to work together in the database. We'll also be learning how to use Devise today! Can't wait!

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/todoApp

### Day 29: 12th September Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codewars. Rails Devise Lesson. Github revision. PhotoApp & Portfolio page CSS 

**Thoughts**: Long day today! 10am - 11pm Woah. First time I committed a full day to coding here at Alphacamp! It really felt like a productive day, with the most important point being I finally got back to touching my portfolio page again. Fooling around with CSS can be a real time-waster but sometimes it allows me to try out different ways of showing page content.

Did some research on top websites and I'm just baffled by the level of creativity and skill out there... I wonder how Singapore fares against these overseas web developers and designers..their websites are crazy good.

Hope that I'll still have these kinds of days as time goes by. Definitely good for growth.

### Day 30: 13th September Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lesson on comparing & picking Gems, photoApp CRUD

**Thoughts**: Today was a short one since I had dance in the evening. Good progress on photoApp and I can't wait for it to be complete. Loving the CSS on the frontpage but I'm kinda dreading the CSS I may have to do for the other pages. Repeating code and figuring out CSS layers is not a fun thing to do.

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/photoApp

### Day 31: 14th September Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: photoApp CSS, Devise issues

**Thoughts**: Faced an issue today - where we wasn't able to get the 'id' from the parameters passed in the browser URL - because there was none! Took Sha and I a long time to figure it out. These kinds of errors are the worst - you don't know what's wrong but you can't move on without solving it. Major headache!

Well, good part is with every issue we solve we manage to learn a little more about what we're doing. More and more to go :)

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/photoApp

### Day 32: 15th September Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rails Test, PhotoApp Comments

**Thoughts**: Today we had our very first class Test! Was kinda nervous at first, as I know I always tend to overestimate my abilities and maybe fall prey to careless mistakes here and there. Heard we needed to re-create a new rails application from scratch and that kinda gave us a rough gauge of the test scope. Well, the duration was 2hours so it was definitely not going to be THAT easy.

10mins into the test, and I crackled a laugh. Among the small, pieces of 'wrong' codes scattered around various files, there was this cunning easter egg inserted into the CSS file. It changed the colour of any text appearing on the page to White - making it invisible. It was so smart because it took advantage of the normal testing process - Put some text on a page so see if it's the correct page that's working. Needless to say, it fooled us for a good few mins.

Throughout the classes with our instructor guiding us and 'writing down' examples and notes for us, it definitely is a good practise for us to do something on our own.

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/photoApp

### Day 33: 16th September Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: photoApp TextArea, CSS

**Thoughts**: Another challenge lost against CSS. Sometimes there are just things you need extra power with - like expanding a 'div' field background together with the textarea as the lines of text grows more and more. It's true what people say - that the small details are the ones that will take the most time as we develop more and more things.

It felt good to be able to fix this issue. It's like another trick learned that I can use in the future! :D

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/photoApp

### Day 34: 17th September Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Combining rails & javascript for CSS

**Thoughts**: Alright so, we've got most of our photoApp done up, and all we need to do was to add finishing touches before submission tmr. The last module I was working on required a bit of brainpower!

The challenge was to display the first photo of the album as an 'album preview'
- If the first photo was deleted, the preview will then be the 'new first photo' that would be shifted up
- If it was an empty album, a default picture would be displayed instead
- This was to be applied to all albums that the User has

First, I had to loop through the albums that the User had, and store the 'first photos' into an array of photos.
Then, after the page was displayed, a piece of Javascript code will then run to change the 'background' attribute of each album to become the photo. I only managed to get it work just before the presentation, and I was gleefully delighted. 

I love being able to use code to perform something that we need to rack our brains over. It was a feature that I was genuinely proud of :)

### Day 35: 18th September Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class discussion on photoApp

**Thoughts**: Today we reviewd our photoApps.. Once again like the To-Do App, always very impressed with what my classmates have done. One impressive thing is always the aesthetics, somehow their projects have very beautiful colours & aesthetics, and the use of a 'standard bootstrap view' with a big image covering the main page

Maybe I should start to base my projects on this? I guess the look & feel is impactful considering the amount of effort needed to do it.

Also what amazes me is the resourcefullness - some of them really are able to find useful Jquery scripts to enhance their projects

**Link(s) to work**: github.com/kedanco/photoApp

### Day 36: 19th September Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class on Active Record relationships - linking models

**Thoughts**: Confusion!! Today we learned about connecting relationships between difficult models. After many rounds of has_many, belongs_to and probably a combination of both, our brains were fried.

Sometimes, even with a whiteboard and sufficient thinking power, it's hard to understand concepts that are not exactly clear, and goes in circles. up till now, I still can't accurately explain how to link up different models in different relationships.

If I have time, this will definitely be something that I will come back to.

### Day 37: 20th September Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Web hosting & Rails Environments

**Thoughts**: Today's lesson was about web hosting & rails environments! We covered the few hosts that provide the basic hosting capability, and also learned how to identify a good web host. Next up we learned about Rails environments! Basically imagine it as different 'kind' of setting for your application. There's 'test', 'development' -> whatever we're doing now, and 'production'.

I can't wait to try deploying a rails app to Heroku! Don't know how much it'll cost but, I guess I'm always itching to try new things and achieve new milestones.

### Day 38: 21st September Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery & AJAX

**Thoughts**: At first, the exercise on adding jQuery/Javascript and making it work with Rails was pretty simple. AJAX was another way of accessing & displaying data that didn't need the page to refresh. This was the thing making our like and share buttons work on the page we're reading! 

I honestly crave for more time everyday to do my own reading and learning and projects. Seems like there's so much things to learn that I don't have enough time for it.

### Day 39: 22nd September Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: twitterApp CSS, Comments

**Thoughts**: As usual, I got back to the convenient things that I'm used to doing. I think sooner or later I would have to push myself to step out of this comfort zone. Be the one to develop new functions, be the one to come out with new ways of organising things. Nothing much done, and I've been very distracted with reading up on Cryptocurrencies :/

### Day 40: 23rd September Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: twitterApp Likes & Ajax

**Thoughts**: Spent a whole chunk of time settling admin stuff for Danzation and other stuff, then spent the 2nd chunk of time falling asleep and settling AJAX for the twitter Like button to work...After extending my hours to 8am++, it finally worked!

I was stuck with passing information between Users and Tweet folders, but I managed to render the like/dislike.js.erb file in users folder by using 'render' in the tweets controller!

Kinda tiring, but I enjoyed the triumph at the end when I finally got it to work!

### Missed a Day: 24th September Sunday, 2017

### Day 41: 25th September Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: RSpec!

**Thoughts**: Writing Test codes is a totally different thing altogether.. The thought process is definitely different because we have to look at our Model/Controller code, simulate the test with some test variables, and ensure the code passes the test! 

We focused on Model specs today - which performed checks if the Model was supposed to be working correctly. Did it have the required parameters to exist? As usual, we had new terms again - such as 'describe', 'is_expected_to' and 'it'. Still very unfamiliar with how it all functions but, well we got it to work! Except for one pesky litter error always alerting that my email was did not check for case sensitivity - maybe I need to specify some special parameters to be testing on.

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 42: 26th September Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Controller Specs, Follower Following

**Thoughts**: TwitterApp wasn't really going as well as I thought it would be - I didn't have the luxury of time to continue with it, and getting stuck with issues on the 'follower' 'following' relationship really proved to be a problem.

We moved on to controller Specs today, and things got REALLY complicated. Even though controller code was not a big chunk of code to test, simulating the conditions can be really tricky. We had to think in terms of 'sample data', and 'variations' created, and ''

### Day 43: 27th September Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Git Exercises!

**Thoughts**: Today we learned the 'dangerous' parts of Git, like amending commits... haha. That already sounds like a bad thing to do. Well, sometimes we need to turn back time, make minor edits to our commits or resolve some minor mistakes here and there before we push the code up to the master branch!

After trying out the examples i kinda understood what it's for, and this command's kinda useful actually.

The idea about Github is that, with great power comes great responsibility. With a Version Control System that has branching and merging capabilities, we need to be careful what we do with it. Our coming project's gonna be in groups of 3 (similar to capstone) so, I guess there's a lot of things we need to be careful of!

### Day 44: 28th September Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Twitter Assignment Presentation

**Thoughts**: I wasn't very satisfied with the outcome of our Twitter Clone. Being stuck on the 'followship' issue, and not being able to have the time to finish some of the extra stuff, not to mention the amateur level of CSS... lol.

One surprising thing was, I think we were the only group that implemented the twitter character count check feature? I think it was quite a handy javascript thing to do (so quickly, compared to figuring out the like button AJAX...haha!)

See-ing Naz's work really inspires me. He's always one step ahead. Personally, I really feel he's someone I look up to in terms of discipline (time commitment) and skills. Deploying on Heroku, and even having notifications is just...wow.

Well, time to work even harder.

### Day 45: 29th September Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing Twitterapp, reading up on rails materials, portfolio page

**Thoughts**: After housewarming at Jacinta's, went over to Starbucks to get some work done.. Wasn't a very productive session as I was hovering between starting a new practise project, going through Udemy tutorials, or watching/reading up on materials so it was kinda a bit of everything.

Ended up working on my portfolio page, which is the best & biggest investment on myself right now. Who would want to hire a web developer who doesn't even have his own site?
Need to spend more time and finish this ASAP.

### Missed A Day : 30th September Saturday, 2017

### Day 46: 1st October Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Discussion on Capstone project

**Thoughts**: Today's 3hour long discussion covered detailed user stories, A basic WIT Ai flowchart, additional planning on our mockups and the methodology to go about doing it. Was dead tired after we finished, and I'm still doubting how we can go about doing this idea. Was it a bad idea to have pitched this from the start :/?

I foresee endless amounts of sleepless nights as we explore this WIT.Ai technology. =(

### Day 47: 2nd October Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FB Linking (OmniAuth), Started ShoppingApp, Portfolio page

**Thoughts**: Today, I shifted my focus back onto my portfolio page. After seeing Naz's freelance project and his own page, I kinda felt ashamed about my standards (LOL). Yea it was that bad. Started doubting my abilities, but I guess I just need to FOCUS and spend time developing my site first before anything else!

The short session on FB linking with OmniAuth wasn't very thorough but it was a good introduction, means I need to spend time to explore it on my own!

I spent a good 3-4 hours at night changing my portfolio page. Used pagepiling (https://github.com/alvarotrigo/pagePiling.js/) and Animated-headlines (https://codyhouse.co/demo/animated-headlines/index.html) to re-organised my site. I now realise the power of SASS - it would make my CSS code to much neater and easier to read. I was dying inside while re-organising my CSS, partly I wanted to remove irrelevant code but I was also scared to break things.

### Day 48: 3rd October Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Braintree Documentation, seeds.rb, E-commerce App

**Thoughts**: I've heard of Stripe as a payment gateway but not Braintree..nonetheless, we're gonna integrate it as part of our E-Commerce assignment. Looking forward to try it!

Also, we learned this new thing where we are able to provide 'seed' data to our program to use when we start out our application. Seems cool and my teammate used it by creating a first 'Admin' account at the start. Also, if you're resetting your database to test from the start, it's a good system to ensure your program data is always 'new' whenever you test. Seems cool :)

Had very good progress for our E-commerce app today. Sha added Facebook Authentication, Jacinta did up a VERY nice products show page, and I managed to display products, add products to cart with quantity and display them! In the user's cart! I even included a 'badge' to show how many products are present in your cart haha. Tiring day from 10am-10pm+ but I'm really enjoying the progress today. If everyday was like this, progress would be good but I wouldn't have time for anything else.

Is it a worthy trade-off? Hmm..

### Day 49: 4th October Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rails mailer, E-commerce App

**Thoughts**: Today we covered Rails Mailers! An in-built function in Rails that allows you to configure & send emails. It's awesome be coding away and realise that such an important feature is actually in-built in Rails...makes everything so convenient.

With letter_opener_web, we checked the emails that we 'sent' and could see the text of the emails! Cool knowing how these work and I could imagine how a full Rails applications would make use of these

### Day 50: 5th October Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rails PORO, SOLID principles

**Thoughts**: Covered RAILS PORO today, and also looked at SOLID principles. After a walkthrough in class, it's kinda amazing to know how some applications can be 'restructured' to make code cleaner and easier to understand using Service objects.

Spent some time working on shopping cart too - If the product is already added in cart, adding more of it should not create another row but it should update the existing quantity in the shopping cart!

### Day 51: 6th October Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Bootstrap Alerts, played with transitions. Clear cart module, edited Views.

**Thoughts**: After so long into this assignment, finally fixed the alerts. Definitely an eyesore. CSS Transitions are fun! Though i don't completely get how it works yet. Need to find something to practise on :)

Added a 'clear cart' button, and edited the view slightly. Also, after some practise implementing AJAX for some functions doesn't seem as complicated now. Yay! :)

### Missed A Day : 8th October Sunday, 2017

### Day 52: 9th October Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advanced Active Record Queries, Tag module for Shopping App

**Thoughts**: Today's query lesson was quite sleepy...I think it was partly due to all the confusion from queries, haha.

Actually, today's lesson was rather important. In this case, Active Record queries are like shortcuts for SQL statements - getting data from the database. Think of chaining different instructions together to create a long, complete instruction to get the data you want.

Also, finally managed to get my productivity back and 'kinda' finish the Tag module! Now I need to do a filter on the searching of the products!

### Day 53: 10th October Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: No-Model Forms & Simple Queries, Shopping App repo rebirth

**Thoughts**: Today got worse. Came late to class and was super sleepy. Same thing, it was an important lesson on how we could use forms that did not target a model (like customised forms), and also perform custom queries (e.g. multiple conditions, targeting multiple tables)

Then came the worst part of the day. It was when we had to remove the .env file from our repo. the .env file contains KEYS and CREDENTIALS that the project needed to integrate logins/authentication with other platforms, such as Facebook and emailing services.

After trying to squash our commits together, we then found out that the .env file appeared beforehand in an extremely early commit. Alright, then we had to remove all commits, and re-upload everything as 1 commit.
Lo and behold, the .env file was still present, within our old branches!!!

We then decided to create a new repo, but before that we had to pick our minor edits here and there and combine everything manually... All our edits were over the place. We should have checked that we pulled each others' work before we starting all the rebasing and shifting of code.

After creating a new repo and cloning it, everything finally worked properly without any trace of .env file in the repo. But, some edits were missing. Time for more back-tracking of work...It was a serious case of file recovery and version control (more like version chaos)

### Day 54: 11th October Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Rspec practise, Shopping App Filter

**Thoughts**: Rspec practise once again! I think my exit ticket prayers got answered, haha!

Once again, I faced difficulty recognising the test matchers syntax, and got errors here and there as a result...But the class exercise always provided good practise for what we needed to know.

Still not very fond of the idea of writing tests. And, it's part of the test next week! Guess i'll have to spend time doing some revision before the test dawns on me.

Worked on the shopping app 'filter panel' late at night, managed to get it to display properly beside the products (but totally not responsive...everything breaks when we resize the window lol). Good and Bad : I got carried away with CSS and didn't touch the functionality of it, but I really like how it looks and it sticking to the user's viewport upon scrolling down! Definitely worth the time spent, haha!

Note to self: Spending more time is useless if you're not productive. Control how you spend your time!

### Day 55: 12th October Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Shopping App Presentation

**Thoughts**: It was a fun day seeing each others' eCommerce App! I think so far, this eCommerce App is the assignment that I'm most proud of. It wasn't because of how it looked, or that it included several other external features (Facebook Login, mailers etc.) but that I managed to code some of the functionalities that felt complex at the start. I'm really happy about the updating quantity part - It may seem natural for all eCommerce Apps but it really challenged my thought process. Glad I got it working :D

### Day 56: 13th October Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: IBM Company Visit, crowdapp

**Thoughts**: IBM was pretty amazing. Most importantly - the offices and the view. Level 42 at Marina Bay Financial Centre can't go wrong, haha! Their employees and working structures are quite impressive as well. I like how they kinda adapted to new technologies/workflows to cater to a wide range of clients - be it clients who want web apps, mobile apps, blockchain, back-end systems etc.

Though, everyone seems to at least have a CS degree or relevant...I doubt that even if one day I join theses MNC corporations I would go far without credentials.

Managed to import my CSV file into Rails! Achievement unlocked! But throughout this process I discovered another issue - now i'm pretty unsure how to go about initializing my models with the different parameters :/

### Day 57: 14th October Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Imported CSV into Rails, initialized methods (crowdapp)

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty productive - I continued with the CSV importing function. Before that, I'm glad I realised that my app was created with Sqlite. Not knowing what's the best solution, I just deleted the app and started over, haha!

Migration of columns, and getting the model code in was fast. I guess these are parts that after repetitive practise, we start to understand it better and get used to doing it right.

The real challenge came - for each row of the CSV, I needed to initialize 4 different model objects! There was code to check this and that, convert string to hash, initializing the crowd density for all days and hours...
After all the logic was completed, it was a barrage of errors that I had to overcome. Solve, next one appears, and then the next... It was endless! But with each problem solved, came a wave of assurance that it is gonna work.
I barely managed to get it done before dinner - no more errors! Though some of my code logic dont seem to work properly.

Today's learning was also attributed to the fact that I had to keep thinking and googling for different kinds of problems to find different solutions. 

Today was a good push! :)

### Missed a Day: 15th October Sunday, 2017

### Day 58: 16th October Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class Recap

**Thoughts**: Today we did a Recap of everything we've learned so far in our bootcamp! There was a lengthy amount of questions ranging from general programming to html/css to ruby to rails. Of course, there's so much more we learned that didn't get covered theoretically but, the main essence of what we learned got covered.

I feel like this recap won't be enough and the only possible way to really remember everything is to do everything x-times. So far, the assignments are the ones that really push us to practise the old stuff and try out new stuff. Guess I gotta practise more? haha.

### Day 59: 17th October Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Final Exam day!

**Thoughts**: Today we had our final class exam! The exam requirements include the normal models & views, setting up assocations similar to twitter's follow/following and like, 1 external API add-on (I tried Facebook Login), and Rspec testing.

Pretty much died from doing these and by the time we stopped at 3pm, I was just initiating the following relationship. Wasted so much time on (considering) setting up 'time inputs' and other stuff. Still can't understand how we could actually get everything to work, try the very best not to copy when things are actually pretty similar if you compare to the twitter clone LOL. 

I think this time round, I didn't exactly perform well under stress. Really thought I could go faster, but truth is I code so slowly. Haiz.

### Day 60: 18th October Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Deepavali! Exam continuation.

**Thoughts**: Happy Deepavali! Today, I had to continue the exam that we didn't finish yesterday. Productive time at Starbucks working on the following relationship and the 'attend' function (similar to twitter like) but had to go for dance before I could finish Ajaxifying the things correctly. Coded at SMU again before prac, coded on the bus home... Idk if time is really not enough for this exam or I'm just doing things too slowly.

It was a good push though, Re-wiring our brains to think for ourselves "what's the next step" without having tutorial-like instructions there to follow. At least, The ajax stuff works and I was almost done with the Facebook login. Almost, because when coding, nothing can be smooth-sailing and there has to be some error somewhere that will hinder your progress.
Even life says that we need some villains now and then. Lol. But, I'm somewhat sick and tired of errors and errors and errors..Sometimes you just need a break from all these. Sigh!

Hope I don't fare too badly for this one.

### Day 61: 19th October Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Capstone project revision

**Thoughts**: Today we had one whole day to work on our capstone project. Finally after discussing with Vin, we really couldn't see Wit.AI going anywhere...We didn't understand how to go about progressing at all. Also, I found out that drawing circles on google maps was actually not that hard. Javascript examples were understandable and we just had to build it such that depending on what the user filter, we had to pass in an array of locations to draw circles for.

After some consideration, we made the change. also revised the data structure for our app and made it simpler. Hope the capstone can really progress now.

### Day 62: 20th October Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Whole Day Capstone!!

**Thoughts**: Progress was awesome - Added Area and District models and changed how the code initialized with the help of Vin. He focused on the navbar options (dropdowns) and I continued with initialization - making sure everything works etc. It took me until around 12am for the import code to finally run properly! The main issue was that not every row would return a postal code, and thus couldnt initialize the district and area for that place.

Tried many alternatives to source for the postalcode - if it exists elsewhere in the Address and not as the last 6 characters, then it'll search for that. If not, then that row will not be added. I would wish I have the time and mental capacity to capture every single exception but the way I see it now, it has to be done manually :/

Though, at least now we can visually see progress. Fumbling around research on Wit.AI was so imaginative.. we really couldnt see anything happening, haha. 

And, even though I kinda wasted a bit of time in the morning hanging around reddit and nextweb articles, afternoon was really productive. yay!

### Day 63: 21st October Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Morning productivity :)

**Thoughts**: Woke up super early to code today. Did some productive stuff between 5.30am - around 9am! 
Managed to draw out the different Area circles on Google Maps, and also tried the codes with a larger source base of around 200+ places! The importing took so long that I actually managed to finish my cereal before it ended lmao.

Somethings I changed today:
Drew circles based on Areas
Organised & Added tasks on Trello board
tracking time spent for export/import codes
tried out rails query logic

Excited to see more progress!

### Missed a Day: 22nd October Sunday, 2017

### Day 64: 23rd October Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Exam App Review, Solved CSS Issues, init crowd density method

**Thoughts**: Wei-Liang is really a great instructor. Learned quite a lot from just a review of my exam app. A lot of stuff wasn't complete but still, managed to learn a few lessons from it. One was of course, the things that I'm not so familiar with i.e. Writing test cases.

Progress on the Capstone project slowed down a little, and we're encountering CSS issues...mainly because of copy-pasted code for our landing page. Well, it really speeds up the work, but things would be better if the copy-pasting and integration was done by someone with more front-end proficiency. It's like trying to combine apples and oranges together and asking why you don't get a completely nice fruit.

I guess we all learn, but meanwhile, I'll have to be solving additional issues from our other tasks :/

### Missed a Day: 24th October Tuesday, 2017

### Day 65: 25th October Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Capstone, Job-Hunting & Setting up Business workshop!

**Thoughts**: Finally back at the Capstone project! Managed to change the models/associations and have my districts and areas also have different crowd densities for each day & time. I don't think it's right to nest up to 3 or 4 loops together but... it works. Something to really improve on if I have the time for it.

And that's important, because today what was shared in the Job-hunting workshop emphasized on what Software Development means to us. Our understanding and take on this 'craft' of ours will determine if we impact our interviewers/clients or not. Kinda agree with this, because someone who cares about the code will be someone who always strives for improvement and innovation right?

After learning more about setting up a local business, I think my time is not ripe yet. I'm definitely not even earning enough for the fees to be negligible, so I shall not jump the gun right now. But definitely learned some useful tips for the future.

### Day 66: 26th October Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Capstone

**Thoughts**: Had a great reflection today on the user stories and the aims of our capstone project. Scoped down the user stories, and after planning out the view, the method by which we need to implement the code seems clearer. Can't wait for the main features to be done and start playing with it!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/kedanco/crowdapp

### Day 67: 27th October Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Capstone, personal profile

**Thoughts**: Continued with Capstone and tried to revamp my personal profile page. Decided that a personal profile page dedicated mainly to my web development presence would make more sense than adding in dance elements as well. The revamping didn't go well, as I tried to add numerous features from UI kit templates but I didn't realise parts of the code were missing as it wasn't a full 'free' release. Time wasted but at least I have a clearer idea now.

For capstone, it wasn't much progress today. We seem to be lagging behind on the back-end functions and there's so much implementation to be done. Well, time to double-up!
