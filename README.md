### Day 1: 12th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course

**Thoughts:** Started back on my Round 2 by going through a Linux Udemy course. Even though i'm primarily using Linux for coding but there's so much idk about this OS, when it allows for so much possibilities in terms of configuration. Gonna be an interesting journey ;)

### Missed A Day : 14th September Friday, 2018

### Day 3: 15th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Personal Savings Calculator

**Thoughts:** Came up with a new layout for a company's site I'm helping out with, specifically just the savings calculator component. Working with previous CSS is hard especially when there's so many inline styles >< bad idea but I still went ahead and added some inside, because I'm unfamiliar w the CSS structure and didn't want to change anything. Managed to code out the layout I want, thank God for Inspector tools.

### Day 4: 16th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course, React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't take too much dry lecture on Linux in 1 day so I started on another React Node course to trigger my memories on whatever I've learned on React before. Also great to learn some Node. Wonder if I should do something more vanilla JS before learning about all these frameworks again.

### Day 5: 17th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Continued and learned more about setting up Express app, linked it to Heroku. Spent a shitload of time configuring and installing ohmyzsh and listening to explanation lectures, hope I'm reaching the code intensive part soon.

### Day 6: 18th September Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course & Calculator

**Thoughts:** Set-up passportJS w google OAuth, Setup mongoose w mLab, refactored code and although there was little coding done, there was a lot of explanation throughout the videos and that at least made me understand the things we were doing.

### Day 7: 19th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done w/ Authentication part of the course! Length explanations but good reminder of the 'proper' way to do things, what to take note of etc. Also worked on a existing wordpress site for a client - almost done!

### Day 8: 20th September Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done with the Dev vs Prod section, learned a little more in detail about the 2 environments and how to prepare for them when committing a project somewhere, or dealing with API Keys and URI's. Started on React part of the course! After much time spent on the back-end set-up, it's finally time to start on the front-end!

### Missed A Day : 21st September Friday, 2018

### Day 9: 22nd September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Markdown and Commandline course

**Thoughts:** Realised that I didn't go through 2 of Wes Bos's courses touching on the basics of Markdown and Commandline. Managed to learn a bit more tips and tricks to make my workflow more efficient!

### Day 10: 23rd September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Started on the front-end part of the course, but when the videos began on explanations on reducers and how the whole React and Redux ecosystem works together, suddenly I'm confused again. Need to find a way to understand + remember the essence of it before moving on.

### Day 11: 24th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Made quite a bit of progress today, but can't understand Redux fully. I think when I look at the code and trace where it goes systematically, I get a better understanding compared to listening to explanations. The best check is to be able to write the code from scratch yourself and understand what each code is for, but I'm not there yet!

### Day 14: 28th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course
