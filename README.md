# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 14th August Monday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn Ruby Fundamentals, completed a few ruby exercises!

**Thoughts:** Still weak on loops, arrays & hashes. The syntax is so different from what I've learned before in javascript/Java/PHP, think I need a lot more practise to get used to it.

### Day 2: 15th August Tuesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Class on loops, expressions, Classes etc. Completed Leetcode Ruby exercises, more to go

**Thoughts**: Better understanding on Ruby and it's application, down to the same period where you struggle & waste time on code to learn useful things through fixing mistakes and realising the right things to do. Kinda dry on the explaining parts and wish we could have more time to learn by doing & trying out even if it's IRB.. also wish I had more time to start coding projects already haha. I foresee myself useful a lot of Devdocs.io in the future :)

### Day 3: 16th August Wednesday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Leetcode exercises - YAY! Time to move on to Codewars :)

**Thoughts**: Used a lot of code for Ruby exercises - code had a lot of extra checks, re-assignments & loops. Code was messy and unclear - note to self - always prepare pseudocode before starting to code. Read up more on Ruby and find out more on the classes & available functions/methods/classes that would help to save time/make things easier. Also, I wonder if my javascript will deprove after all these weeks of Ruby :/

### Day 4: 17th August Thursday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Product Design process - from idea to product, and also the Software Development Life Cycle :) Tried Codewars!

**Thoughts**: Was part of a startup before as a PM, being thrown into the process and learning about it is so different. I saw a lot of wireframes, drafts & plans of the project that dictated the product features, and also saw how the designer worked on these. Good to learn and go through the process properly :) The brainstorming exercise as also useful to teach us how to identify & prioritise the features - and then putting it up visually so we have a better image of it.

### Day 5: 18th August Friday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned & used git/Github! Started on TicTacToe exercise w/ Regent

**Thoughts** I tried to use Git/Github before and didn't understand how it worked. Today's exercise was really useful, because we practised until we learned how to resolve conflicts when editing the same file with another person! Also, I now understand how to properly fork repositories and upload your commits to github. This makes any dev work so much more convenient if there's any work I wish to post up :) Maybe it's time to really beautify my Github Page and do something with it!

### Day 6: 19th August Saturday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practised Codewars

**Thoughts** Struggled with some of the exercises... one involving encoding duplicate strings, and one that needs to return the first non repeating letter. Realised that even though my code was able to resolve most, some special test cases came up and I needed to revise my strategy :/ a lot of time wasted but I think i'm getting used to a lot of the useful Ruby Magic Methods haha.

### Day 7: 20th August Sunday, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some reading on dojo materials, Wrote a basic Kopi<>English translation app!

**Thoughts** So I cleared some of the homework videos we had on computational thinking, and also one link on advanced html/css. Think that's something I have to remind myself as I continue to learn. Then, managed to finish most of a basic app that translates between our singaporean 'kopi' ordering slangs to english! Had this conversation with some of them at lunch that some of us weren't sure what the slangs meant and we'll need to google to know it... Maybe this app can make life more convenient (there's already existing ones on android but I just felt like trying). You're welcome to download it, run it and see how it works :D
P.s. Used instance variables for the hashes involved but not sure if it's the right thing to do? If not, how do you access variables in another methods?
