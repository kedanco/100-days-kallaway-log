### Day 1: 12th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course

**Thoughts:** Started back on my Round 2 by going through a Linux Udemy course. Even though i'm primarily using Linux for coding but there's so much idk about this OS, when it allows for so much possibilities in terms of configuration. Gonna be an interesting journey ;)

### Missed A Day : 14th September Friday, 2018

### Day 3: 15th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Personal Savings Calculator

**Thoughts:** Came up with a new layout for a company's site I'm helping out with, specifically just the savings calculator component. Working with previous CSS is hard especially when there's so many inline styles >< bad idea but I still went ahead and added some inside, because I'm unfamiliar w the CSS structure and didn't want to change anything. Managed to code out the layout I want, thank God for Inspector tools.

### Day 4: 16th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course, React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't take too much dry lecture on Linux in 1 day so I started on another React Node course to trigger my memories on whatever I've learned on React before. Also great to learn some Node. Wonder if I should do something more vanilla JS before learning about all these frameworks again.

### Day 5: 17th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Continued and learned more about setting up Express app, linked it to Heroku. Spent a shitload of time configuring and installing ohmyzsh and listening to explanation lectures, hope I'm reaching the code intensive part soon.

### Day 6: 18th September Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course & Calculator

**Thoughts:** Set-up passportJS w google OAuth, Setup mongoose w mLab, refactored code and although there was little coding done, there was a lot of explanation throughout the videos and that at least made me understand the things we were doing.
