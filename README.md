### Day 1: 12th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course

**Thoughts:** Started back on my Round 2 by going through a Linux Udemy course. Even though i'm primarily using Linux for coding but there's so much idk about this OS, when it allows for so much possibilities in terms of configuration. Gonna be an interesting journey ;)

### Missed A Day : 14th September Friday, 2018

### Day 3: 15th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Personal Savings Calculator

**Thoughts:** Came up with a new layout for a company's site I'm helping out with, specifically just the savings calculator component. Working with previous CSS is hard especially when there's so many inline styles >< bad idea but I still went ahead and added some inside, because I'm unfamiliar w the CSS structure and didn't want to change anything. Managed to code out the layout I want, thank God for Inspector tools.

### Day 4: 16th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Linux Course, React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't take too much dry lecture on Linux in 1 day so I started on another React Node course to trigger my memories on whatever I've learned on React before. Also great to learn some Node. Wonder if I should do something more vanilla JS before learning about all these frameworks again.

### Day 5: 17th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Continued and learned more about setting up Express app, linked it to Heroku. Spent a shitload of time configuring and installing ohmyzsh and listening to explanation lectures, hope I'm reaching the code intensive part soon.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 6: 18th September Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course & Calculator

**Thoughts:** Set-up passportJS w google OAuth, Setup mongoose w mLab, refactored code and although there was little coding done, there was a lot of explanation throughout the videos and that at least made me understand the things we were doing.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 7: 19th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done w/ Authentication part of the course! Length explanations but good reminder of the 'proper' way to do things, what to take note of etc. Also worked on a existing wordpress site for a client - almost done!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 8: 20th September Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Done with the Dev vs Prod section, learned a little more in detail about the 2 environments and how to prepare for them when committing a project somewhere, or dealing with API Keys and URI's. Started on React part of the course! After much time spent on the back-end set-up, it's finally time to start on the front-end!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Missed A Day : 21st September Friday, 2018

### Day 9: 22nd September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Markdown and Commandline course

**Thoughts:** Realised that I didn't go through 2 of Wes Bos's courses touching on the basics of Markdown and Commandline. Managed to learn a bit more tips and tricks to make my workflow more efficient!

**Link to work:**

### Day 10: 23rd September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Started on the front-end part of the course, but when the videos began on explanations on reducers and how the whole React and Redux ecosystem works together, suddenly I'm confused again. Need to find a way to understand + remember the essence of it before moving on.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 11: 24th September Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Made quite a bit of progress today, but can't understand Redux fully. I think when I look at the code and trace where it goes systematically, I get a better understanding compared to listening to explanations. The best check is to be able to write the code from scratch yourself and understand what each code is for, but I'm not there yet!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Missed A Day : 25th September Tuesday, 2018

### Day 12: 26th September Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CS50, React Node course

### Day 14: 29th September Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Completed billing part of application by setting up middleware, and ensuring that credit addition process works correctly. Very technical explanations but still wish there was a simplified version for me to understand what goes where.

**Link to work:**

### Day 15: 30th September Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Started documenting my freecodecamp learning points, and re-organised some of my notes. There's so much CSS stuff to take note that notes become really important, something to solidify my learning by writing down, and something to look back on.

**Link to work:**

### Day 16: 1st October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Codewars

**Thoughts:** Worked on some JS codewars today, other than doing basic FCC challenges, think codewars exercises is one of the best way to test your knowledge and understanding of the language. As usual, the one-liner answers after always put me to shock...

**Link to work:**

### Day 17: 2nd October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Completed the Accessibility section of FCC today, skipped the Flexbox and Grid areas and moved on to ES6! Gained a better understanding of the changes, makes me more confident to use it now.

**Link to work:**

### Day 18: 3rd October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Completed ES6 section of Freecodecamp! feels good to document the learning points down, something I can refer to someday. Spent majority of my other time wrapping up a Wordpress project for a client, glad to finally complete one!

**Link to work:**

### Day 19: 4th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Halfway through Regex portion of Freecodecamp! Loving this habit of taking notes.. Maybe coming up with my own cheatsheet one-day will help a lot as a summary too.

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 5th October Friday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 6th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 20: 7th October Sunday, 2018

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 21: 8th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Continued with survey creation part of React Node course, momentum's really bringing me to finish the course soon. Looking forward to completing this final product and maybe adding some of my own features.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 22: 9th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Added the Mailer class and configured it into the React Node application! With the diagrams and explanation, it was really easier to understand the steps. Gotta keep going.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Day 23: 10th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Node course

**Thoughts:** Couldn't solve the issue with mailing the survey into my email, all the code seems right but it just doesn't work. Probably some connectivity issue between client and server, not very productive day.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/fullstack-reactnode

### Missed A Day : 11th October Thursday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 12th October Friday, 2018

### Day 24: 13th October Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Vue JS Meetup

**Thoughts:** Went for a VueJS meetup today! Quite awesome to be learning it finally, definitely easier to start writing the first few lines of code compared to React. But, things get complicated when you start to add in the methods or start passing props around.

**Link to work:**

### Day 25: 14th October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial, Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Still couldn't solve the React Node connectivity issue. Did some freecodecamp, and moved on to the Tutorial on React's side. I figured if I felt messy with the current tutorial might as well do the default one.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 26: 15th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Completed another feature of the React page tutorial's tictactoe game. Played around with it and added my own restart button to display when the game is won. Understood it a bit better when I played around with it.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 27: 16th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** React Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Continued with TicTacToe Game! Implemented the Restart button on my own, and added the guided move history feature from the tutorial. Gonna continue to add more features into this game!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 28: 17th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Feelings accomplished today! Cleared 4 more features off my React TicTacToe Game :)

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 29: 18th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Added confetti and victory fanfare music to the app! Started with improving the aesthetics.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 30: 19th October Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Solved an issue with the confetti when restarting the game. Took very long with this bug, and finally learned how ComponentDidUpdate works. Still kinda blur about how diff functions get re-arranged around but it's better now. Another unsolved bug with the 'Next Player' status display, have a feeling it's also got to do with setState callbacks.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 20th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 31: 21st October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Solved the previous bug. Could have binded diff functions to `this` but just shifted the setState code into React's lifecycle methods for it to make more sense. Also done with the aesthetics improvement!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 22nd October Monday, 2018

### Day 32: 23rd October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Able to Setup a form for switching around the Player icons! Though it works, the player can change the Letter/Icon at any point throughout the game and that inserts a 3rd letter into the board. Need to work on restricting that change to before the game starts.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 33: 24th October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Continued with Data structures portion of Freecodecamp! Went through objects and arrays syntax and methods, good revision.

**Link to work:**

### Day 34: 25th October Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Started on Object-Oriented Programming part of Freecodecamp :) Halfway through, but glad that it touched on `prototype` as I have always wondered why it always appears when dealing with objects.

**Link to work:**

### Day 35: 26th October Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Manage to complete check off 4 items off my feature list! Really motivated to push through and finish this soon. This constant practise has been great building up a momentum to stay familiar with the code and continue improving the app!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Missed A Day : 27th October Saturday, 2018

### Day 36: 28th October Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp, TicTacToe Game

**Thoughts:** Done with OOP section of Freecodecamp! Some old stuff, some new stuff, but always something that amazed me with JS. Only left with the Functional Programming section and I'm done with this certificate! Also took time to finish the CSS Grid section since I'm using it for the TicTacToe Game. For the game, I managed to display the ranking board, and fix a bug where status won't reset properly after Player2 wins. Also revised the requirements for the app. Gonna use localStorage to store the ranks, and also plan to refactor my code to be more React-like. Haven't been making use of Components to separate the code and now everything is just one big chunk inside index.js

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 37: 29th October Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day rushing my Wordpress wireframes, but managed to squeeze in time to complete of the Responsive web projects : A Survey form! Had some trouble aligning radio buttons/checkboxes with their labels, but all's good with some help from `<li>`. It's been sometime since I just worked on HTML and CSS, so simple but great refresher.

**Link to work:**

### Day 38: 30th October Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp, TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Wanted to continue with the next FCC project, a landing page, but it required flexbox, so I'm gonna learn that and do the project together another time. Done setting up ranking board for TicTacToe, Allowed player to edit their name (so that they can save their score under their name), and added a button to reset the rankings.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 39: 31st October Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Continued with Freecodecamp, completed the Flexbox section and worked on the landing page.

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 1st November Thursday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 2nd November Friday, 2018

### Day 40: 3rd November Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Added the last feature into the game, which is a button to reset the icons to default. Pretty simple since I've gotten used to using componentDidUpdate to change state and re-render changes.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/kedanco/react-tictactoe

### Day 41: 4th November Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Cudy Platform

**Thoughts:** After shifting a lot of code around, finally managed to solve the responsiveness issue. Settling CSS took longer than figuring out the logic error. This is what happens when there is no proper structure in place when adding CSS. Flexbox exists but not utilised, inline-styling all over and different conventions and naming patterns floating around.

**Link to work:**

### Day 42: 5th November Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** TicTacToe

**Thoughts:** Completed my TicTacToe game!!! Refactoring the render functions into Components wasn't that difficult once I understood how state and props worked. Finally felt like I have gained a good level of understanding of how React works so far. Think there's still a number of things that I need to learn but this was a good milestone. Took a lot of hours and days to really work on this consistently.

**Link to work:**

### Day 43: 6th November Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Took some time to do up my Landing Page properly! Learned another way to use an image for a section's background, learned that I'm more used to CSS Grid than Flexbox (don't like how it works), and that HTML and CSS skills really need consistent sharpening no matter how good we get with other languages.
Almost to 50days!!

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Halfway through functional programming section of FCC. Being absent for a week after finishing my TicTacToe project wasn't a very good move. Very tempted to start on another project but think I should finish up these front 2 sections of FCC first!

**Link to work:**

### Day 45: 15th November Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Finished the functional programming section!

### Day 46: 20th November Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Completed the last Responsive project - a technical documentation page. Now I'm officially done with the first 2 certificates! Moving on to the Front End Libraries, completed the Sass segment today. Sass is so useful, but the thing that makes it hard to use is how you're required to add the source files in.

**Link to work:**

### Day 47: 21st November Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Started on the React part of FCC Today! Also tried finishing up some Udemy courses but wasn't very productive.

**Link to work:**

### Day 48: 22nd November Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeJS Course

**Thoughts:** Returned to the NodeJS Udemy course today. Since I'm pretty aimless with my programming recently, shall aim to finish this course for now, and then maybe I shall start my next project with it.

**Link to work:**

### Day 49: 23rd November Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeJS Course

**Thoughts:** Continued with the NodeJS course. Explanations are so in-depth but I'm just very excited to start coding something out of it!

**Link to work:**

### Day 50: 24th November Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeAPI Course

**Thoughts:** Got quite dry on the NodeJS course, so started on a front-end masters Node API course that focuses on setting up back-end API w node. Quite interesting w some basic exercises.

Finally at Day 50! Though I can't finish this round by this year end judging by my progress.

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 25th November Sunday, 2018

### Day 51: 26th November Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeAPI Course, Node-Firebase chat app

**Thoughts:** Continued with a number of tutorials into the NodeAPI course, reaching the testing stuff now. Also completed a short tutorial to build a node-firebase chat app, so happy to get it working when I faced some issues with firebase!

**Link to work:**

### Day 52: 27th November Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeAPI Course

**Thoughts:** More than halfway through NodeAPI course. Done with testing, organizational structure and touched on Mongo, Mongoose.

**Link to work:**

### Day 53: 28th November Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CrowdCluster

**Thoughts:** Went back to revise Ruby and touch up the CrowdCluster app. Thinking of changing the filters and modifying some of the existing functionality, and maybe adding in some additional data as well (cafes, bars, landmarks etc.)

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 29th November Thursday, 2018

### Missed A Day : 30th November Friday, 2018

### Day 54: 1st December Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Started with the React section of FCC! Feels good to have a recap after the previous React courses, still feels like React is such a complicated thing to be put on FCC. Still thankful to them for adding it in though, just wonder if there any simpler process to learn React.

**Link to work:**

### Missed A Day : 2nd December Sunday, 2018

### Day 55: 3rd December Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** FreeCodeCamp, NodeAPI Course

**Thoughts:** Completed the React & Redux section of FCC! Also continued with NodeAPI course, almost finishing it! Things are getting quite complicated when we deal with Auth and stuff, and i'm finding it hard to follow-up :/

**Link to work:**

### Day 56: 4th December Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CS50

**Thoughts:** Went back to CS50! Covered 2 lectures, gonna give myself until end of this month to finish the videos.

**Link to work:**

### Day 57: 5th December Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NodeAPI Course, React Random Quote Machine

**Thoughts:** Done with NodeAPI course! Gotta find a project to implement all of it by myself again, cuz following the course just doesn't cut it... And some of the later lessons (auth, middleware) start to get a little bit more complicated. Still, learned a lot about Node in this course and I'm glad I finished it!

Also re-did the Random Quote Machine in React. Pretty simple!

**Link to work:**

### Day 58: 6th December Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Markdown Previewer

**Thoughts:** Completed FCC's Markdown previewer project. Didn't really understand how to use the marked.js library, wasted some time figuring out how to render the markdown text

**Link to work:**

### Day 59: 7th December Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Advanced Web Dev Bootcamp, cross-road Game

**Thoughts:** Started on the Advanced Web Dev bootcamp, and also thought of applying the css transitions learned to do a cross-road kind of game where you have to avoid obstacles!

**Link to work:**

### Day 60: 8th December Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Cross-road Game

**Thoughts:** Set-up random functions for multiple values of the obstacles which serve as enemies. One issue I faced was being unable to find any way to connect JS variables to the values used in CSS Keyframes. Guess the animations would have to stick to set values.

**Link to work:**

### Missed 5 Days : 9th December Sunday, 2018 to 14th December Friday, 2018

### Day 61: 15th December Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Node.JS

**Thoughts:** Went back to Node.JS today. After a week of not coding, I really need to put in the time to get my mind back on the right track. Multi-tasking several aspects of front-end really ain't easy.

Learned about Web Sockets today! Such an interesting and useful thing to exist in the web.

**Link to work:**

### Day 62: 16th December Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Node.JS, Tetris

**Thoughts:** Continued with Web Sockets lesson! Also started with a Tetris Game tutorial in JS. Maybe I'll add on new features like what I did with the Tic Tac Toe game!

**Link to work:**

### Day 63: 17th December Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Didn't have much time today. Continued with the tetris game, halfway through the video! Everything is vanilla JS with functions controlling the game mechanics, but with a big number of rotations, borders, collision checking and moving of player and arena positions, the code looks kinda messy.

**Link to work:**

### Day 64: 18th December Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Finished the tutorial, and started working on additional features for the game. Added a main menu screen to pick difficulty before starting the game, re-organised the code.

**Link to work:**

### Day 65: 19th December Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Added Music to the game! Also completed the following features: Game and Music pause, controls display. Excited to start on this Random Mode feature if the player chooses Hard difficulty - whereby a number of fun things can happen... definitely a challenge to code it though!

**Link to work:**

### Day 66: 20th December Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Added Time Elapsed to the game! Fixed multiple bugs while getting it to work, definitely was not easy dealing with Date Time values so just used a simple variable as counter instead.

**Link to work:**

### Day 67: 21st December Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Fixed Time Elapsed, and added a Row Sweeper Power-up to the game! Faced an issue where I couldn't append an Image element, think it's some error with referencing created elements.

**Link to work:**

### Day 68: 22nd December Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Worked on adding a gameover screen, but still facing an issue toggling visible/hidden on the HTML elements. It'll be easier if I used React for this though.

**Today's Progress:** Advanced Developer Bootcamp, Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Merry Christmas! 2 CSS portions of the AdvDev Bootcamp, covered transitions and keyframe animations. Next up is Flexbox, don't really like it but I hope I learn something new.

Tried to continue with FCC React-Redux section but it's really difficult after some time of not touching it. Maybe it's time to spring up another React project :)?

**Link to work:**

### Day 70: 26th December Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Advanced Developer Bootcamp, Tetris

**Thoughts:** Happy Boxing Day! Half-done with AdvBeg Bootcamp Flexbox section, and was kinda productive on my Tetris game. Solved so many bugs, and the mainmenu,pause,restart mechanics of the game finally work completely fine. I realise that a lot of the bugs came from putting `addEventListeners` inside functions that could have been called multiple times.. Proper planning of how these functions are organised would've have fixed a lot of issues.

**Link to work:**

### Day 71: 27th December Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Started changing how the layout was organised with Grid, so that the game would at least be responsive.

**Link to work:**

### Day 72: 28th December Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Advanced Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Completed Flexbox section of AdvDev Bootcamp, only today did I realise how many sub-topics exist in the course. So much things to cover! Still more used to Grid than Flexbox...

**Today's Progress:** Docker video

**Thoughts:** Didn't code much today, learned about Docker and finally understood what it was for and how it worked from a big picture view. Shall add it to my list of things to learn!

**Today's Progress:** Tetris

**Thoughts:** Started with 'random mode' of the Tetris game. Finally got it to pick from random game modes over a set interval of time, but facing an error with the interval.

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Revised the basics of jQuery and AJAX, creating simple XHR requests.

### Day 82: 24th January Thursday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Finished the jQuery and Axios section! Great exercise at the end that needed to create 4 types of request with the same API. Now I understand the differences better.

Halfway through Testing w Jasmine section. Testing really makes me doze off everytime I go through it...glad to know that different testing frameworks are really not that different from each other.

### Day 83: 25th January Friday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Finished Testing w Jasmin section! Love this section as it made testing very simple and easy to understand. Used to have this impression that testing was a very LARGE, DRY and DIFFICULT part of coding. Just need some time to think about what you want to test, how you wish to test it, and reorganise the code accordingly.

### Day 84: 26th January Saturday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Completed Advanced Arrays section of the bootcamp! Quite a dry section but nonetheless useful to revise what I've learned about these ES6 functions from Wes Bos ES6 course. Learned that the multiple parameters to the functions (value, index, array) are actually optional parameters! So far have not used these but finally understood what those are for, didn't understand it previously when I read the documentation.

**Today's Progress:** FCC Drum Machine

**Thoughts:** Took 1 long session to finish the Drum Machine. Took longer than I expected, with references to HTML elements, React fundamentals and syntax from my previous apps, but it went well!

Some things I learned/re-learned:

- Flexbox still the easiest for vertical + horizontal centering
- Audio volume goes from 0(mute) - 1(loudest)
- data-\* attributes (strings) on HTML elements can be freely defined. dashed values like (data-name-tag) are converted to camelCase when you access through code. You can access through getAttribute(fullname) or using element.dataset.name
- If you encounter audio.play is not a function, you probably selected the wrong element and your `audio` is not an audio element.
- Getting code to work on codepen is still a dick sometimes.

### Day 86: 28th January Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp, React RPG Game

**Thoughts:** Continued with Closures and `this` section of Adv Dev Bootcamp. Never an easy topic to understand. Also started following this tutorial to make a 2D RPG Game in React. It got fun when we started dealing with using the Sprite and Sprite movements.

### Day 87: 29th January Tuesday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** API Project

**Thoughts:** Tried implementing the collaboration project with SALTx by using Web Components instead of React. Was planning to render multiple instances of the same template, so might as well right? But it isn't as easy as it seems.

### Day 88: 31st January Thursday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Finished the rest of Closures and `this` keyword section of the Adv Dev Bootcamp. Have no idea what I'm doing w the challenges of `call` `bind` and `apply`. Need to revisit this section again for further revision.

### Day 89: 1st February Friday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** API Project, Dungeon Crawler

**Thoughts:** Doing the API Project reminded me of my basics. Used a loop to append HTML, with string interpolated JS values of the fetched content. No Web Component/React needed to render multiple instances of Div blocks!

Dungeon Crawler tutorial got me confused over bug solving. Missed some code in the video and had to scroll front and back to find out what I missed. Happy with the progress so far, was able to understand the reasons for implementing `connect` for `mapStateToProps` and other processes.

One day I'll be able to do it myself, without following a tutorial.

### Day 90: 2nd February Saturday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Dungeon Crawler, Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Completed Dungeon Crawler tutorial! Quite amazing to see the game work, other than the tiles being rendered slightly off. But I guess, it's no choice if were're dealing with 2D sprites and a matrix.

Completed the OOP Section of Adv Dev Bootcamp! Not as confusing as closures and `this` but still challenging when dealing with prototypes.

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Following the node-express-mongo section of this course seems all too familiar. Faced an UnhandledPromiseRejection problem yet again, and I don't know how to solve it. Shall stop here for today.

### Day 93: 8th February Friday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Done with setting up the back-end of our full-stack project! npm install to create a new project, create a new express app and connected it with mongo database. Stopped at jQuery section.

### Day 94: 10th February Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Completed todos app section! Dealing with the delete function of the app game me a big issue. It wasn't CORS, it wasn't a typo, the URL was correct, but the DELETE request just returned a 404 error. At least everything else works.

**Today's Progress:** CS50, Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Went through 4th lesson of CS50 covering Data Structures. A 2hour lecture still feels content-heavy despite the clear and detailed explanations and examples given, but I think I won't be able to remember everything if I don't implement it. Looking forward to the web-related topics!

Almost finished with Part 1 of ES2015. Have used most of these before so it serves as a recap. Most impressive one I haven't used was passing an entire destructured object as a function argument. Pretty neat.

### Day 96: 16th February Saturday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp, Tetris

**Thoughts:** Completed the entire ES2015 section of the bootcamp. People weren't kidding when they said ES2015 provided a bulk of upgrades for the JS language.

Spent some time continuing my Tetris game. Dealing with setInterval, setTimeout in the same function and having to pause/continue it ain't easy at all.

Finally can continue on to make the random modes happen!

### Day 97: 17th February Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Tetris, CS50

**Thoughts:** After trying to solve some bugs and learn more about my Tetris app, here are some extra JS stuff I learned today.

- having a `name:` before a block or loop is called a `label`. It can be used to 'label' the loop/block for `continue` or `break` statements.
- `val | 0` format of code makes use of JS's type coersion that happens when you compare double/decimal values to an integer.
- You can try to trace the `caller` of a callback by using `methodName.caller`
- With vanillaJS you can't include a JS file in another JS file..either use a html file (script tag), framework or lib to handle module importing, or dump the code into 1 file.

Also finished 5th Lecture of CS50 covering the basics of HTTP, HTML and CSS. Basic content but great to have a very simplified explanation and summary of everything.

### Day 98: 18th February Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Adv Dev Bootcamp, Tetris

**Thoughts:** Completed ES2016/ES2017 Section of Adv Dev Bootcamp! More new things that I haven't even seen before. This is eye-opening. Think I'll have a lot of revision and application to do before I can remember the new things well and use it regularly.

Today while dealing with Tetris, I learned that:

- It is immensely hard to try 'pausing' things. Should have used a game-related library for this.
- You can listen to start/ends of both transitions and animations, and they are different!
- It is also tricky to coordinate fillRect and strokeRect

Bug solving took like 3-4 hours. But at least I'm getting more familiar with the game. Can't wait to complete it.
