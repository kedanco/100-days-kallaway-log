### Day 1: 24th February Sunday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CS50

**Thoughts:** Finished lesson 6 of CS50, talking about Python. It was mostly focused on the syntax, but serves as a good introduction! Also tried a bit of Flask. Seeing Jinja inside Flask reminds me of Ruby on Rails.

### Day 2: 25th February Monday, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CS50, Adv Dev Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Finished lesson 7 of CS50, covering Web Programming. Combining JS and python to create a web app with basic routes and validation serves as a easier,simpler version of a mern stack.
