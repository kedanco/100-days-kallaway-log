# 100 Days Of Code (Round 1) - Log

### Day 1: 3rd January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started on ECommerce project, Rails Revision

**Thoughts:** Needed to revise on Ruby and Rails, after such a long time of spending my time doing other things, whatever I learned about Ruby and Rails seemed to have become pretty rusty...Thank gooodness we had our old projects for reference!

Spent some time planning and organising migration files, this process required me to revisit the project structure and plan out the models/fields needed before I even started migratin anything (reduce 'change' migration actions).

Slowly but surely, I'm gonna get my skills back.

### Day 2: 4th January Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued ECommerce project

**Thoughts:** Preparing the essentials: homepage, flashes, setting up folders and files.

### Day 3: 5th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued ECommerce Project

**Thoughts:** Did up the main few pages, spent some time getting pissed over CSS (Arranging and aligning icons and text in DIVs, in the end a simple Table did the job pretty easily.) Filled up some content for the individual pages (contact, home etc.) Still got much to do for back-end!

### Day 4: 6th January Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued ECommerce Project, Javascript30 Day 1

**Thoughts:** Today I started on the Javascript 30 challenge! I realised that since i'm stuck with the intermediate algorithms challenges on FCC, maybe I can strengthen my basics by starting on this before heading back. The difficulty of the challenges is really a notch higher than the previous ones...

The first project is a Drumkit - Having different buttons play different drum sounds whenever the user presses the respective keys! Got it done in an hour or two but spent some time trying to add in mouseclicks (not that simple since there's multiple elements), maybe next time!

Also touched up my portfolio site - it's so time-consuming writing the content from scratch and manually writing CSS for each element... Well it's all in the name of practise! Hopefully next time I will have a set of CSS shortcut snippets at my disposal :)

### Day 5: 7th January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 2, Portfolio Site,

**Thoughts:** 2nd day of Javascript 30!
Using CSS variables to edit image properties and values, also learned the difference between nth-child and nth-of-type (Important!)

Gonna add the 'gallery with filter' feature to my projects - not sure how I'm gonna nest everything under Javascript30 but well, gonna make my site nice!

### Day 6: 8th January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 3

**Thoughts:** Apparently I missed a project - CSS Variables was the 3rd video. But anyways, completed the 2nd project today - a CSS + JS Clock! It was kinda difficult to get the 'center' correct and align the 'hands' of the clock correctly, but everything was rather smooth and easy to understand.

With simple if statements, I even managed to fix a glitchy transition whenever the clock reset to 0 seconds. yay!

### Day 7: 9th January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 4

**Thoughts:** Managed to squeeze in time to complete my JS30 before another dance class - handling arrays today! Had a great time trying out and following the video, and editing my answers to the ES6 syntax.

Since everything's console-log based in this lesson, I don't think I'll put it up unless I have a very great idea how to display these.. haha!

### Day 8: 10th January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 5

**Thoughts:** Flex panels was fun. Always wanted to do something like this! Shall dedicate some time to learning flex after I'm familiar with Grid.

Maybe for my dance site, I should add this in as one of the contents on the site.

### Day 9: 11th January Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 6

**Thoughts:** Spare time's getting shorter everyday, Now i can barely manage to complete an hour of coding.

Started my coding quite late, and was quite sleepy by the time I was done with my Javascript project. Gotta prioritise this more the next time!

### Day 10: 12th January Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 7

**Thoughts:** Revised Day 6's work and got Day 7 done pretty quickly - Simpler array exercises compared to the first one.

### Day 11: 13th January Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 8, Project page

**Thoughts:** Today's project was on HTML Canvas, and it was fun! Well, this tutorial is pretty much the tip of the iceberg, and I'm sure there's so much more available things to play with. Heck, there's even 3D Canvas that can animate and rotate stuff around!

Also did up a proper image grid for my portfolio site's project page! Almost wanted to give up making a text label appear over when hovering on top of the image, but managed to make it work. Gonna add image transition and also prepare the images for my projects! Excited to finish it!

### Day 12: 14th January Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 9 & 10

**Thoughts:** Today, I found out that creating a range of numbers in Javascript, from X to Y, was highly inconvenient. I miss the awesome (1..4) notation in Ruby where it was so convenient, and we could directly do a loop after that.

After some researching, I found that a normal for loop would be the best way. Well, I spent a little more time but I managed to do project 10 by myself! :D

Project 9 was a very simple lesson on multiple console. commands, so I decided to just move on to 10.

### Day 13: 15th January Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 11

**Thoughts:** Playing around with HTML5 Video controls was pretty fun! Nothing wildly interesting, or mathematically challenging for this project but at least we covered an important part of this form of media - videos!

Was stuck on the fullscreen button for a little while but managed to accomplish it. Yay!

### Day 14: 16th January Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 12 & 13

**Thoughts:** Today's projects on Key Sequence Detection & Slide on Scroll was pretty simple.

For the Key sequence, it was a simple 5-min video on event-listening to user's keyboard inputs and checking them against an array.

Sliding images in on scroll was more interesting, I've seen countless websites, especially landing pages, utilize this to make the website more interactive, and I've always wondered how to make it happen, even reverse it.

Thanks to the previous CSS Clock project that covered transforming and translating X and Y values, this project was easier to understand. Gonna implement it soon!

Also uploaded my first few JS30 projects to my portfolio site! Gonna find time to add everything in soon :D

### Day 15: 17th January Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Javascript30 Day 14

**Thoughts:** Barely enough time for coding today! Covered a familiar topic - data types that pass by value or reference. An important concept that solved the simplest but most head-scratching of problems, and something that I read about again in YDKJS

Squeezed out time for the video, understoof and best takeaway were the multiple methods that allow for copying by value from arrays! Dealing with objects still seem pretty limited.

Also, prepared the rest of my screenshots today. Gonna be filling up my js30 image grid!
